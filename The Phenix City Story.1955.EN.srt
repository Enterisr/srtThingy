1
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,243
This is Clete Roberts
reporting from Phenix City, Alabama.

2
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:30,938
I'm here to learn the truth
about Phenix City.

3
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,879
Like many other Americans
and people throughout the world...

4
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,485
...I had heard the story
of the criminal syndicate...

5
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,918
...which allegedly controlled this city
for many years.

6
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,524
And I'd heard the tale
of the cold-blooded murder...

7
00:00:42,693 --> 00:00:44,285
...of Albert A. Patterson...

8
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,656
...Alabama's attorney general nominate.

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,094
The declaration of martial law
in Phenix City...

10
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,063
...was also well-known to me.

11
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:55,672
And like many of you, I had read of it
in the pages of national news magazines...

12
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:00,799
<i>...such as LIFE, TIME, Look,
and The Saturday Evening Post.</i>

13
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,475
Recently, I learned that
the Columbus, Georgia Ledger Enquirer...

14
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,879
...was being considered
for a Pulitzer prize.

15
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,918
A prize later won for the part it played...

16
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:14,888
...in unmasking the criminal syndicate
here in Phenix City.

17
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:17,390
This prompted me as a reporter
to come down here...

18
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,461
...to find out what really happened.

19
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,122
To learn how the good people
of Phenix City had triumphed over evil...

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,962
...and how democracy
had successfully asserted itself...

21
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:29,128
...over a very real dictatorship.

22
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,137
I learned many shocking facts...

23
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,004
...from the people who lived
the Phenix City story...

24
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:35,975
...the real people involved.

25
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:38,580
You will meet them in a moment
as I talk with them...

26
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:41,149
...and I warn you
that what you hear them say...

27
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,377
...you will find hard to believe...

28
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:45,181
...but they speak the truth.

29
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,653
I warn you too
that what you are about to see...

30
00:01:47,824 --> 00:01:50,349
...in the picture
which follows my news report...

31
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,858
...will shock you too.

32
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,020
It is brutal, it's shocking...

33
00:01:54,198 --> 00:02:00,364
...but it is based upon the actual story
of what happened here in Phenix City.

34
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:05,305
We in the news reporting profession
are agreed that this gentleman...

35
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,204
- How are you, Ed.
- Fine. How are you?

36
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,435
Fine. Come on down, Ed.

37
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:12,104
This gentleman
is one of the great reporters in the South.

38
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:14,182
He's Ed Strickland
of The Birmingham News.

39
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:17,718
Ed, will you look right straight
at the United States of America now...

40
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:23,485
...while I ask you some questions about
the job of reporting that you have done...

41
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,457
...on the Phenix City story?

42
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:29,497
When did you first become interested in
the situation in Phenix City? How long ago?

43
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:32,692
About 1950, Clete,
I first went to Phenix City...

44
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:37,203
...and began making some investigation
for my paper from time to time...

45
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,569
...and later for another organization.

46
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,904
I want you
to tell those people right there.

47
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,740
Look at them while you talk to me...

48
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,145
...because I want them to have a good look
at a great reporter.

49
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:51,811
How many months did you spend
or years did you spend on the story?

50
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:53,957
On the story of the Patterson murder...

51
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:56,922
...of course it began on June 18th
of 1954.

52
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,790
I went there within three hours
after the murder...

53
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:04,229
...and stayed for six months
without a break...

54
00:03:04,401 --> 00:03:07,336
...with more than two or three days
at a time during that time.

55
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:11,201
You mind telling us about the news break
from the point of view of a reporter...

56
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,902
...that you got
on the news of Mr. Patterson's murder?

57
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:17,069
I did have a wonderful news break
in that...

58
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,977
...I happened to be
trying to reach Mr. Patterson...

59
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,017
...via long-distance telephone
at the time of the shooting.

60
00:03:23,186 --> 00:03:28,055
And got the word immediately
from the operator in Columbus, Georgia...

61
00:03:28,225 --> 00:03:30,216
...that Mr. Patterson had been killed.

62
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:33,659
A few moments later, with my
photographer, I was on the way down there.

63
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,995
Ed, do you think that the story about
conditions that existed in Phenix City...

64
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:41,228
...has been exaggerated in any way?

65
00:03:41,405 --> 00:03:44,033
It has not been exaggerated.
It could not be exaggerated.

66
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:48,735
From my knowledge of the things
that went on there prior to the shooting...

67
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,210
...and sometime thereafter...

68
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,373
...it would be impossible to exaggerate,
I would believe.

69
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:56,781
You put this all down in a book,
have you not?

70
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:57,977
Yes, I have.

71
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,817
<i>Gene Wortsman
of the Birmingham Post-Herald and myself...</i>

72
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,960
...have collaborated
in writing a book on Phenix City.

73
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:05,151
Another question.

74
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,320
Do you believe
that the so-called machine...

75
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,295
...the threat, still exists in Phenix City?

76
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,866
I'm sorry to say that it does.

77
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:15,869
It will be some time, apparently
before it will be completely eradicated.

78
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:19,167
There is evidence
that it is trying to come back.

79
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:20,367
Thank you very much.

80
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:22,375
Ed Strickland of The Birmingham News...

81
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:28,485
...who played one of the major roles
in bringing this story to public attention.

82
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,948
With me now is Mr. Hugh Bentley...

83
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,749
...a resident of Phenix City...

84
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:38,657
...whose life was constantly threatened
and whose home was dynamited...

85
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:43,061
...because of his determination
to fight the criminal syndicate.

86
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:47,932
Do you believe, Mr. Bentley,
that these people who blew up your home...

87
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:53,133
...knew that your family was in the house
at the time the dynamite was detonated?

88
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,334
Oh, yes...

89
00:04:54,511 --> 00:05:00,643
...we've been dealing with a problem here
of organized crime...

90
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,513
...operated by the syndicate.

91
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:08,056
It was one of the acts of violence,
of about 14 or 15...

92
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,386
...that was perpetrated on our people.

93
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,853
Mr. Bentley,
after these constant acts of terrorism...

94
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,591
...these threats against yours
and your family's life...

95
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:21,898
...why did you, and why do you continue
to live in Phenix City?

96
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:26,441
Well, I was born and raised here,
and this is my home.

97
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,979
And during this...
During the past 25 years...

98
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:35,312
...l've had an opportunity
to teach a lot of children...

99
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:37,476
...in my Sunday school class.

100
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:40,350
During that time, actually,
we won a lot of them to Christ.

101
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:46,622
And we feel like that there's more good
in the community than there is evil.

102
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:51,166
We're basing all our strength of faith
in the good of our community...

103
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,735
...hoping someday
that they will rise up...

104
00:05:54,905 --> 00:06:00,707
...and throw off
this ugly reputation it has...

105
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:03,869
Our town has had for the past 100 years.

106
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:08,484
I feel like it's a dirty filthy code...

107
00:06:08,652 --> 00:06:10,620
...that I inherited from my father...

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,314
...that I don't wanna hand down
to my children.

109
00:06:15,225 --> 00:06:17,455
Thank you, Mr. Bentley.

110
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:19,793
One of the men who worked...

111
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,727
...one might say fought,
side by side with Mr. Bentley...

112
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,424
...is a member
of the Russell Betterment Association...

113
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:30,164
...in combating the criminal syndicate
was Mr. Hugh Britton...

114
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,570
...also a resident of Phenix City.

115
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,838
We have an appointment now
to talk with him at his house.

116
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:40,449
How many honest elections
have you experienced here in Phenix City...

117
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,744
...in your lifetime?

118
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:45,988
Well, I'd say...

119
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:50,923
...the only honest election that I know
anything about here in the last 43 years...

120
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,789
...was one that we have held here...

121
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:55,659
...it was a local election,
since we had our new sheriff...

122
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,801
...and police department here.

123
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:05,973
I talked with Mr. Britton
before the camera was shooting.

124
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:10,010
He told me a story about a man
who asked him once the same question.

125
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,148
What was that answer you gave him?

126
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:16,251
Well, I'd have to explain
that when I was a boy...

127
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,819
...that we, just for a pastime...

128
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:21,685
...at night, used to take flashlights
and broomsticks...

129
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,224
...and go down to the city dump
to hunt rats.

130
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:26,123
We killed some big ones.

131
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,423
And that...

132
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:36,405
That a rat, if you turn a light...

133
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,506
...a bright light in a rat's face...

134
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,166
...that he'll run for cover.

135
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,711
And it didn't make any difference
whether that rat is in the city dump...

136
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,576
...or in the city hall.

137
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:49,842
All right,
thank you very much, Mr. Britton.

138
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:55,421
This gentleman you see is Quinnie Kelly,
who was pointed out to me.

139
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:59,289
Mr. Kelly, will you come up here please?
He was pointed out to me earlier today.

140
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,123
- I'm Clete Roberts.
- Kelly's my name.

141
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:03,596
Happy to know you.
Look this way, will you please?

142
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:06,668
Would you mind taking your hat off
so the folks can see you?

143
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:10,704
Quinnie Kelly is a janitor here in the
Russell County court house, are you not?

144
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,068
Yeah, that's correct.

145
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,372
You are a witness, I know,
in the current murder trials...

146
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,310
...now under way
in Birmingham, Alabama.

147
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:22,645
And I have heard
that you have been threatened, is that true?

148
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,810
Yeah,
I've been threatened many, many times.

149
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,478
- Many, many times?
- That's right.

150
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,521
How did these threats come to you?

151
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,320
- Over the telephone.
- What did they say?

152
00:08:31,494 --> 00:08:32,791
Well, the first one comes...

153
00:08:32,963 --> 00:08:35,625
...he wanted me to remove my pistol
and badge, I wouldn't.

154
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,131
He said if I didn't remove
it I wouldn't live...

155
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,768
...and if I did I wouldn't live.

156
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,335
- lf you didn't remove it?
- Yes.

157
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:45,531
And your badge is as a deputy sheriff.
How long have you been a deputy sheriff?

158
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:48,644
Well, I've been deputized
ever since Rhett Tanner has been here.

159
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:52,111
I see. All right, now,
what other threats have you received?

160
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,772
Well, I got a call Sunday.

161
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,716
Threatened and asked me had I seen what
was in the newspaper and I told him I did.

162
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,287
- Uh-huh.
- And he says time is running out...

163
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,188
...and if I didn't I wouldn't never live
to testify in this next trial.

164
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,090
How do you feel? Does that scare you?

165
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:08,025
We're not scared one bit in the world.

166
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:11,031
And you're gonna go down there
and tell the truth, are you?

167
00:09:11,201 --> 00:09:14,193
I'm gonna tell the truth.
If I tell anything, it'll be the truth.

168
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,202
Has anybody...? Is any guard on you?

169
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:19,706
Anybody trying to help you stay alive
until you get to the trial?

170
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,070
No, sir, they are not.

171
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:23,769
- You carry a gun?
- Yeah, I carry a gun.

172
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:25,710
- You know how to use it?
- Yeah.

173
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,543
- Will you use it?
- Yeah, I'll use it.

174
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:31,915
Thanks. Quinnie Kelly, ladies and gentlemen.
Janitor, right here in Russell County.

175
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:33,817
- You're not afraid?
- No.

176
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,014
How about your family?

177
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,092
Well, my wife's upset.
Been upset since they talked to her.

178
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:40,320
Been in the care of a doctor
ever since she...

179
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,627
- They went down there and talked to her.
- All right, thanks very much, Mr. Kelly.

180
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:47,201
I know that you're a busy man.
Pleasure meeting you.

181
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,462
- Glad to meet you.
- Goodbye, sir.

182
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,949
It is now my privilege
to take you with me...

183
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,923
...to the home
of Mrs. Albert A. Patterson.

184
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,063
Mrs. Patterson is the widow...

185
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,668
...of the man who was murdered
on June 18th, 1954...

186
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,739
...the attorney general nominate
of this state of Alabama.

187
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,342
She is a grand Southern woman...

188
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,102
...mother of four boys...

189
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,146
...very proud of her son, John,
who came home from the wars...

190
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:19,978
...and took over the task
that his father laid down...

191
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,382
...when he died
under an assassin's bullet.

192
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,648
John, today, her son...

193
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,849
...is the man who must prosecute,
indict...

194
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,088
...and bring to justice
the killers of his father.

195
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:35,228
Mrs. Patterson lived here
under the threat of the machine...

196
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:40,304
...and she can answer our question
as to what life was then like.

197
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:42,303
We go now to her home.

198
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,503
How many free elections...

199
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,737
...and honest elections
have you experienced here, Mrs. Patterson?

200
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,507
Well, I've never experienced
any free elections here...

201
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,210
...until this cleanup we had
in our city elections.

202
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:57,014
What about John?
Do you worry about John's future at all?

203
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:01,819
Do you think that he may be threatened
by the machine the way Mr. Patterson was?

204
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:07,995
Well,
I don't think he will be hurt in any way.

205
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,692
I believe he's all right.

206
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:13,360
Do you think
that there's no offer, no chance...

207
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:16,303
...of him being treated
the way your husband was?

208
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,943
Well, I hope there's no chance.

209
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,741
Mrs. Patterson,
you're obviously a woman of great courage.

210
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,849
You've had the strength to carry on.

211
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,917
Where did that courage come from?

212
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:29,247
Why, Mr. Roberts...

213
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:34,591
I suppose I got the courage
from being in this fight so long.

214
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,890
And we had friends
that were really doing their best...

215
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:44,127
...to try to help make our town
a clean place to live in our state.

216
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:47,795
And I have sons and, of course,
I wanted them to have a chance.

217
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:52,205
And we have good people in this town.

218
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,678
And they were under bondage
and they had to have freedom.

219
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,009
And it just took...

220
00:11:58,183 --> 00:12:00,879
It took something terrible...

221
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,647
...to get people to wake up.

222
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,260
And, I think, if the good people of America
could take a lesson from this...

223
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,954
...to always be on the alert...

224
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,624
...and go to the polls and vote.

225
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,533
And do everything they can
to make a good America.

226
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,939
For the past few minutes
we have been dealing in fact...

227
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,944
...fact about the Phenix City story.

228
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:32,277
The people with whom we have talked
are real people.

229
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,816
The people involved...

230
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:38,548
...in what has been described
as an infamous and sordid chapter...

231
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,717
...in American city politics.

232
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:46,387
There has been no careful rehearsal
of speech.

233
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,362
No careful phrasing.

234
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:54,803
People have spoken from the mind,
and from the heart as they felt they should.

235
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,871
We have been with our microphone
and our camera...

236
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,341
...on the streets
of Phenix City, Alabama...

237
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:04,846
...and at the Jefferson County courthouse
in Birmingham, Alabama...

238
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:09,681
...where the second in the series
of murder trials is now under way.

239
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,619
This is Clete Roberts reporting.

240
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:16,756
I return you to your city.

241
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,270
<i>On the banks of
the Chattahoochee River stand two cities...</i>

242
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,998
<i>...joined by two bridges
but living in worlds apart.</i>

243
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,108
<i>This is Columbus, Georgia.</i>

244
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:14,768
<i>Eighty thousand people live here
and work here...</i>

245
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,508
<i>...on the lathes and drill presses,
on the looms and spinning machines.</i>

246
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,717
<i>Here, thousand of boys
become soldiers every year...</i>

247
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,878
<i>...for Columbus is the site
of Fort Benning.</i>

248
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,251
<i>It isn't far from the fort to Phenix City.</i>

249
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,360
<i>You take a bus or thumb
a ride into Columbus...</i>

250
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,496
<i>...you walk across this bridge.</i>

251
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:34,962
<i>Sidney Lanier wrote a poem
about the river flowing under this bridge...</i>

252
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:36,998
<i>...a long, long time ago.</i>

253
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,693
<i>It was much lovelier then.</i>

254
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,799
<i>This is Phenix City, my father's town.</i>

255
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,134
<i>My town.</i>

256
00:15:43,308 --> 00:15:47,574
<i>It has more churches than any city
of its size in the state of Alabama.</i>

257
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,237
<i>Twenty-four thousand people live here...</i>

258
00:15:50,415 --> 00:15:54,078
<i>...send their kids to school here,
just like they do across the river.</i>

259
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,743
<i>Decent, God- fearing people...</i>

260
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:59,857
<i>...most of them, who practice law
and medicine, tend store, keep house.</i>

261
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,617
<i>Not a big city.</i>

262
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:04,694
<i>You wouldn't think to look at it,
that until my father died...</i>

263
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:09,232
<i>...its income from one industry alone
was $100 million a year.</i>

264
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,599
<i>This is, or was, the section where
Phenix City's principal industry flourished...</i>

265
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,502
<i>...and gave employment
to a part of the town's citizens.</i>

266
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,206
<i>Some worked in factories like this one,
making the industry's tools...</i>

267
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,442
<i>...dice, shaved by skilled hands,
or loaded with mercury.</i>

268
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,682
<i>Slot machines, rigged to pay off
one cent on the dollar, if at all.</i>

269
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,191
<i>Whiskey that looked like bonded stuff,
but wasn't.</i>

270
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:38,727
<i>Cards marked with tiny pinpricks
or trimmed...</i>

271
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:42,424
<i>...so the dealers could recognize the aces
and face cards.</i>

272
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,263
<i>Tools of an industry
that flourished for half a century...</i>

273
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,905
<i>...because the good men
looked the other way.</i>

274
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,337
<i>An industry run by men
I went to school with.</i>

275
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,411
<i>Their fathers ran it
and their fathers' fathers before them.</i>

276
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:59,279
<i>An industry that made Phenix City
the most vicious town in the United States.</i>

277
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,316
That industry was vice.

278
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,351
<i>I love</i>

279
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,057
<i>Your ever-loving</i>

280
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:20,694
<i>Loving arms</i>

281
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:24,467
<i>Satan's a woman all dressed up to kill</i>

282
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,874
<i>Satan's a woman all dressed up to kill</i>

283
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,913
<i>In a honky-tonky city of sin
With a sawdust soul perfumed with gin</i>

284
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:34,177
<i>Satan's a woman all dressed up to kill</i>

285
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,811
<i>Fancy women, slot machines and booze</i>

286
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,788
<i>Fancy women, slot machines and booze</i>

287
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:44,360
<i>With no more money in the sock
And 30 days in the Dixie dock</i>

288
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,327
<i>You wind up with those
Phenix City blues</i>

289
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,662
<i>Lose those Phenix City blues</i>

290
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:57,742
<i>Lose those Phenix City blues</i>

291
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:07,381
<i>You gotta hold me tight</i>

292
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:12,251
<i>You gotta hold me
Oh, so tight</i>

293
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,791
<i>In your ever-loving</i>

294
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:20,125
<i>Loving arms</i>

295
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:24,667
<i>You gotta kiss me sweet</i>

296
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:29,739
<i>'Cos when you kiss me
Oh, so sweet</i>

297
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,138
I shiver

298
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:38,647
<i>From my eyebrows
Right down to my feet</i>

299
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,881
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

300
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:53,931
<i>Got me with your
Captivating charms</i>

301
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,627
<i>Oh, t'ain't no sin</i>

302
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,604
<i>To wanna just be in</i>

303
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:05,470
<i>Your ever-loving</i>

304
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:10,445
<i>Loving
That's what I love</i>

305
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:14,244
<i>Your ever-loving</i>

306
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,914
<i>Loving arms</i>

307
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,255
<i>Woman's body is made of flesh and bone</i>

308
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,363
<i>Woman's body is made of flesh and bone</i>

309
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:29,557
<i>Tied together with a ball of twine
With a paper heart for a valentine</i>

310
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,465
<i>A woman's mind
That's strictly all her own</i>

311
00:19:32,637 --> 00:19:35,800
<i>Tell me, tell me
Have you heard the news</i>

312
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:39,000
<i>Tell me, tell me
Have you heard the news</i>

313
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:42,203
<i>You can't go sinning there no more
They put a big fat padlock on the door</i>

314
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,543
<i>Now you can lose those Phenix City blues</i>

315
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,618
<i>Lose those Phenix City blues</i>

316
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:51,779
<i>Lose those Phenix City</i>

317
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:59,386
Blues
Ah

318
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,157
<i>I love</i>

319
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,101
<i>Your ever-loving</i>

320
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:16,112
<i>Loving arms</i>

321
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,845
More, more.

322
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,182
Make your bets, boys.

323
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,666
Up jumped the devil again.

324
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:39,394
And me with 20 again.

325
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,198
Gotta double up to beat the house.

326
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:45,036
- There's no way to beat this house.
- You're kidding, sport.

327
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,872
If you don't know the game, honey,
Ellie can teach you.

328
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,710
Well, Mr. Ed Gage's son.

329
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,115
What are you doing here?

330
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,123
Fred's a friend of mine, Cassie.

331
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,318
And you don't play with friends,
I suppose.

332
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,458
I guess I'd better put up or shut up.

333
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,761
Young Gage.

334
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,911
You'd better not let me win.

335
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,047
With these cards?

336
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,343
Wipe the dirty look off.

337
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,044
I can't, as long as you work for Tanner.

338
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,849
Tanner's no worse than the others.

339
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:33,854
You ought to take a look at the others.

340
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:37,426
Do you know any other place
a girl can make 200 bucks a week?

341
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,394
The way things are at home,
we can't get along for less.

342
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:44,160
I'll be earning money soon as I finish
law school and I pass my bar exam.

343
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:48,238
- How much and where?
- Fifty a week in Mr. Patterson's office.

344
00:21:48,506 --> 00:21:50,997
Ellie, that's enough to keep you and me.

345
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,977
But there's not only you
and me, my honey.

346
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:57,546
You don't think I'd let my wife work
in a joint like this.

347
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:58,842
I'm not your wife.

348
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,746
You will be.

349
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,048
Even if I keep on working here?

350
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:07,658
Well, maybe this place won't stay open
much longer.

351
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,154
Fred, we...

352
00:22:09,327 --> 00:22:11,727
This place has been here
since we were old enough...

353
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:14,593
...to climb up on an apple box
and reach the slot machines.

354
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,826
Nobody's ever gonna do anything
about it, there's too much profit.

355
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,097
Well,
not everybody's interested in profit.

356
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,207
The ones who are throw a lot of weight.

357
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,433
Mr. Tanner among them.

358
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,509
The cards are marked!

359
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,237
Look at them.

360
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,644
You cheated me,
now give me my dough back.

361
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:35,616
Come on, you cheat, are you gonna give
me my money back? Or do I call the cops?

362
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,990
No, stay out of it.
Do you want to wind up in the river?

363
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,649
Ellie,
you've gotta get out of here right now.

364
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,012
I can't. You know I can't.

365
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:11,587
You can't be around this filth
and not get it all over you after a while.

366
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,986
- Come on, Ellie.
- And if I don't?

367
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,889
Mind letting go of her hands
so she can deal?

368
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,895
You must rate around here, chum.

369
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,396
Hi, Ellie.

370
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,932
Hello, Slim.

371
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:25,626
Where's your sidekick?

372
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,999
I lost him to some babe
out in the front room.

373
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,768
Boy, is she gonna be disappointed
when she finds out all he's got is 10 bucks.

374
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,275
- So long, Ellie.
- Will you be back?

375
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,771
Do you want me to?

376
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:38,711
You know I do.

377
00:23:41,152 --> 00:23:42,915
How about a bet?

378
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:45,221
What's he got I haven't?

379
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,584
I don't know.

380
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,386
I never went to kindergarten with you.

381
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,859
Any extra matches, sir?

382
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,599
You ought to keep away from here, sir.

383
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:03,405
Mr. Tanner might not take too kindly
to Mr. Ed Gage's boy being around.

384
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,175
You know, there ought to be a way...

385
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,681
...to make a lot of money
with these little turtles.

386
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:49,945
- Huh?
- Yeah, have them in a turtle race, you know.

387
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,856
If I could just figure out a way
to fix the winner.

388
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,792
You work on that,
I got to go over and talk to Al Patterson.

389
00:24:58,963 --> 00:25:00,555
- Uh, Rhett.
- Hm?

390
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:03,095
I think we ought to
get rid of Ellie Rhodes.

391
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,292
Well, why?

392
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,528
She's a nice kid. I like her.

393
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:09,696
Yeah, so does Ed Gage's boy.

394
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:11,774
Why, sure he does.
What's wrong with that?

395
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,207
They're both
a couple of nice healthy youngsters.

396
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:18,372
It might not be so healthy if she decided
to tell Ed Gage details of this operation.

397
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,110
Well, that depends on whose health
you're worried about.

398
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:25,154
Anyway, she wouldn't do a thing like that.
She's happy here.

399
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,918
Like quite a few others.

400
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,084
So you won't fire her?

401
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:33,424
Oh, now, Cassie, show some sense.

402
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:37,466
If I were to fire her,
she'd have something to beef about, huh?

403
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,069
Maybe something to talk about, huh?

404
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,533
Anyway, she brightens up the joint.

405
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,540
You won't get anyplace with her.

406
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,440
You know, it never crossed my mind.

407
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,344
And, Cassie, your claws are showing.

408
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,000
- How's it going there, Mamie?
- Very good, Mr. Tanner.

409
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,693
Good. Good.

410
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:15,762
- I'm good.
- Hit me.

411
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,639
Pay me, baby.

412
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:25,248
- Well, you having a good time, fellas?
- And how.

413
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,613
Now, don't go shooting your whole wad.
You know you could lose it.

414
00:26:28,786 --> 00:26:30,777
I'm hot.
It's the house that's gotta worry.

415
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:33,321
Good,
that's the kind of talk I like to hear.

416
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:37,484
You know,
a satisfied customer always comes back.

417
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,496
Well, take good care of them now, Ellie.

418
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,646
What happened to the noisy gentleman?

419
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:02,479
- The boys came and got him.
- Good.

420
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,316
- Well, thank them for me.
- You know it.

421
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,467
- Hi there, Bob.
Hello, Ma.

422
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,195
Hi there.

423
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,677
Well, Ma Beachie. Say, how are you?

424
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:28,812
Tell me, how are things, huh?

425
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,845
Just fine. Fine.

426
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,073
Good to see you.

427
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,708
You know,
I swear you look younger every day.

428
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:38,947
Mr. Tanner, you do carry on.

429
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,349
Tell me, how are things?
And how's business?

430
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,757
- Just fine. Just fine.
- Good, good.

431
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,226
Well, nice to see you, Ma.

432
00:27:46,397 --> 00:27:48,558
- Bye.
- Bye.

433
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:03,780
Hi, Mac.

434
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,150
- You hear from Jeb?
- Uh-huh.

435
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,477
It's tonight...

436
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,246
...but he doesn't know where yet.

437
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:39,842
Afternoon, Mr. Seymour.

438
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,883
Howdy, Tanner. Where were you Sunday?

439
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,920
Well, my dad was under the weather.
I spent the day out there.

440
00:28:45,089 --> 00:28:46,784
You missed a rattling good sermon.

441
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:50,223
That new preacher puts out more fire
and brimstone than Billy Sunday.

442
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,661
- His text was Sodom and Gomorrah.
- Mm-hm.

443
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,062
I sure wish I'd heard him.

444
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,451
Excuse me, please.

445
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:22,720
Hello there.
Well, you're looking as well as ever, Lucille.

446
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,259
You too, Mr. Tanner.

447
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,829
Please go right in.
Mr. Patterson's waiting for you.

448
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:28,556
Thank you.

449
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,436
Come in.

450
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,805
Well, you're taking on
a new partner, huh?

451
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,915
Yeah, my son, Johnny.

452
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,780
I read a piece in the Ledger
that he was coming home.

453
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,750
Him and his wife and...

454
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,822
- Well, two kids now, isn't it?
- Yep.

455
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,890
Well, the baby girl is 18 months now.

456
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,258
Time surely does fly, huh?

457
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,126
You know, I remember
when Johnny was courting Mary Jo.

458
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,366
Yeah, it seems just like last week.

459
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:06,594
When is he getting in?

460
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,830
Late this afternoon. I'm meeting him.

461
00:30:09,006 --> 00:30:12,737
Well, it looks like I showed up
just about the right time, huh?

462
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,279
- You will be needing business.
- No, it will be enough for Johnny and me.

463
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:19,177
Now, there's never enough these days.

464
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,911
Kids to feed, buy shoes for,
taxes going up.

465
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,520
It's rough.

466
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,681
- Even on 14th Street?
- We've got a lot of people to take care of.

467
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,987
- Everybody has got his hand out.
- Yeah.

468
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,654
If you want to stay in business,
you've got to keep those hands filled, huh?

469
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,528
That's just about the size of it.
No, thanks.

470
00:30:38,436 --> 00:30:42,338
- Are you complaining?
- Oh, no, no, no, things are good.

471
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:47,176
But I don't have to kid you, Pat,
you know all the answers.

472
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,476
You ought to be with us, Pat.

473
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,639
I've been wondering
when you'd get to that.

474
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,478
No, I mean it. We'd get along fine.

475
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:57,450
Now,
there's a lot to be said for mutual respect...

476
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,522
...and that's something
we've always had.

477
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,250
Well, maybe it isn't a question of respect,
Rhett.

478
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,123
- Habit enters into it.
- Well, what's the matter with habit?

479
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,424
Half the trouble
with the people in the world today is...

480
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,194
...that they just don't want
to let things stay the way they are.

481
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,396
Meaning 14th Street
and what it represents, huh?

482
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:16,733
Gambling?

483
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:19,672
It was good enough for my father,
and his father before him.

484
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,072
Yours too.

485
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:25,545
Besides, a grand jury has said
there is no gambling in Phenix City.

486
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:27,047
A dictionary definition.

487
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,449
Meaning a gambler
is one who plays a game of chance.

488
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:34,523
They're right, there's no gambling here.
Nobody in Phenix City has a chance.

489
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,887
Oh, now, Phenix City's okay.

490
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,326
There's room enough
and there's money enough for everybody.

491
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:45,663
We're old friends, Pat,
I don't like trouble.

492
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,598
I despise it. It keeps one awake at night.

493
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:53,301
- Why can't those others see that? Yeah.
- Others?

494
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,914
Ed Gage, Britton, Bentley.

495
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,539
- I'm minding my own business.
- I know you are, and I respect you for it.

496
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,516
But they've been trying
to get you in on their side.

497
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:06,418
Well, then I don't have to tell you
what my answer was.

498
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,424
No. Your answer was no.

499
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,659
Rhett, I'm not sticking my neck out.

500
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,423
Why should I?

501
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,763
Phenix City has been what it is
for 80, 90 years?

502
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:21,234
Who am I to try to reform it?

503
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,098
Who are they?

504
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:26,973
Once, I represented you boys.

505
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,408
I even saved a couple of you
from a murder charge.

506
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,571
Now, you don't think
people aren't grateful?

507
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,081
I don't think at all. I don't want to.

508
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,016
It's more relaxing, and safer.

509
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:41,088
You'd be safe enough as our attorney,
Pat.

510
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,950
And it's worth 25,000 a year.

511
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,563
So that's why you dropped in.

512
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,297
Sorry, I want to sleep nights too.

513
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,767
Now, Pat, now look. Lots of people
don't lose any sleep on our account.

514
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,066
- People who go to the same church we do.
- Yeah, well...

515
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:58,965
...you keep quite a few awake.

516
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,635
Yeah. Gage, Britton, Bentley.

517
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,245
Somebody ought to tell them
to pipe down.

518
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,680
Well, don't look at me.

519
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,818
By the way, Rhett,
what are you afraid of this time?

520
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,089
Well, now that you're playing
hands-off, Pat...

521
00:33:17,461 --> 00:33:19,326
...l'm not afraid of a thing.

522
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,591
I'm not afraid of a darn thing.

523
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,668
Flattery won't help you.
Not with Britton or Gage either.

524
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:28,964
I would not demean myself.

525
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,005
It's them who should worry.

526
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,369
You know how we're fixed.

527
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:34,943
People tried to put us
out of business before, yeah.

528
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:36,841
Last year. The year before.

529
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,448
They broke into our places,
destroyed our property...

530
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,882
...made citizens' arrests,
and what did it get them? Nothing.

531
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,157
Except a few of them were fined
for disturbing the peace.

532
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,990
Yeah, well, you've made your point.

533
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,892
The only thing I'd say is,
you could help this town and not hurt it.

534
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,732
Hurt it?

535
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,002
Now,
where would Phenix City be without us?

536
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,730
Yeah, well, we're both wasting breath.

537
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,170
Yeah, but it's all in
a spirit of friendship, Pat.

538
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,175
I wish everybody felt the way you did.

539
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:11,141
Give my best to
Johnny and Mary Jo, huh?

540
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,244
You're a good man, Pat.
You know, I like old friends.

541
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:19,219
It gives you sort of a warm feeling
just to know they're around.

542
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,958
But how many friends
do you really have, Rhett?

543
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,755
Or maybe that doesn't worry you.

544
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,159
Maybe I don't care to think much,
either, Pat.

545
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:31,460
Well, nice to have talked to you.

546
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:36,768
Maybe you'll change your mind
about going in with us?

547
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,069
I won't change my mind either way.

548
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,336
So long, Rhett.

549
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,405
Well, I'll be seeing you, Pat.

550
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,619
Well, I'll be seeing you, Lucille.

551
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,552
You be doing that, Mr. Tanner.

552
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,519
Well, Hugh Britton.

553
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,223
- This saves me a phone call.
- Does it?

554
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,427
Hugh, we're getting pretty fed up with
your citizen's committees, the rest of it.

555
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,630
We're fed up too.
Has that penetrated your mind?

556
00:35:09,807 --> 00:35:11,274
Mm.

557
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,009
That's a nice-looking boy you got there.

558
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,472
What?
No, Dad.

559
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,378
And he is smart too.

560
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,598
<i>Attention, please. Attention, please.</i>

561
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,394
<i>Announcing the arrival
of Trans World Airlines...</i>

562
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,732
<i>...special chartered flight 8653...</i>

563
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,340
<i>...arriving from Germany.</i>

564
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,844
John!

565
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,180
Mary Jo!

566
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:02,455
- Hi.
How are you, Dad?

567
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,685
- Great to see you.
- How are you?

568
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,887
- Where's mother?
- Oh, she's home getting dinner.

569
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:10,261
- Mary Jo, you look wonderful.
- Thank you. How are you, Mr. Patterson?

570
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:11,958
Never felt better than right now.

571
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,468
- Shake hands with your granddad.
- Hello, Granddad.

572
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:18,301
Well, if you aren't the big one.
You're gonna be bigger than your dad.

573
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,036
And she, I'm happy to say,
looks more like her mother...

574
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,704
...just as sweet.
- Oh, only when she's asleep.

575
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:26,606
- Well, we're back, Dad.
- Yes, sir.

576
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:29,514
Well, I hope you haven't forgotten
how to practice law.

577
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,746
What do you think
I've been doing over there?

578
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:35,790
- Prosecuting people.
- War criminals who deserved prosecuting.

579
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,760
Well, this will be a little different.
We're going to defend people.

580
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,795
Help straighten out their legal tangles.

581
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,490
- We?
- Sure.

582
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,158
Patterson and Patterson from now on.

583
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,669
Your name's already on the door.

584
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,898
So we're going to settle down
in Phenix City?

585
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,771
Well, why not, Mary Jo?
It's a pretty nice town.

586
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,878
Well, then it must have changed.

587
00:36:56,046 --> 00:36:58,241
Oh, yes, in some ways.

588
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:00,315
Schools are better.

589
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,543
More decent people moving in
all the time.

590
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,314
- Three new churches.
- Yeah?

591
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,683
Well, that's something.

592
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:11,055
Oh, boy,
is your grandma gonna be glad to see you.

593
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,521
Three more churches.

594
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:46,856
I see 14th Street's still here.

595
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:49,431
We live a long way from 14th Street.

596
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,624
You've forgotten?

597
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,962
I haven't forgotten this.

598
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,895
All right, all right, worrypuss.

599
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,769
I was born and raised in this town,
remember?

600
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,138
I didn't turn out too bad, did I?

601
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:02,939
Do I sound like I'm bragging, Dad?

602
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,947
You once told me that you cut
your eyeteeth on a slot machine handle.

603
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,108
Well, what's the matter with that?

604
00:38:09,286 --> 00:38:11,686
Getting your vices out of your system
early in life.

605
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,984
It doesn't look like everybody
got their vices out of their systems.

606
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,424
Tourists mostly, and a few soldiers
from Fort Benning, of course.

607
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:22,498
There, 14th Street's behind us.

608
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,228
Do they still let the children play
with the slot machines?

609
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,838
Sure, they always will, so long as their
fathers profit by it one way or another.

610
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,633
Not all the fathers profit by it.

611
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:05,536
I do, in a manner of speaking.

612
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,041
- Pop, get my bat and gloves.
- All right.

613
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,772
So does everyone else
who has his business here.

614
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:13,473
That's why nothing will ever happen
to alter matters.

615
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,176
- You don't mean they've given up trying?
- Oh, no.

616
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,014
They're having a meeting tonight.

617
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:21,180
The Russell County Betterment Association,
they call themselves.

618
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:23,826
What happened
to the Christian Layman's Association?

619
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,758
The Good Government League
and The Citizen's Committee?

620
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:29,991
All failed, mostly because in essence,
they were vigilante groups.

621
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,159
Mob violence, even in the hands
of decent people, solved nothing.

622
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,704
Well, what about this new outfit?
- Same men belong to it.

623
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,432
Gage, Britton, Bassett.

624
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,077
- Do you?
- No, I don't, Mary Jo.

625
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:44,442
Oh, they've asked me,
matter of fact they've asked me to head it.

626
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:47,812
- Are you going to?
- No, I'm too old and too tired.

627
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:51,045
What's the use of banging your head
against a brick wall?

628
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,247
- How's the murder rate?
- It's high.

629
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,759
Of course, most of them are listed
on the police blotter as accidental death...

630
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,362
...mostly drowning.

631
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,022
That's what I've been trying to tell John.

632
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,294
Mary Jo, way up here,
you won't even know 14th Street exists.

633
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,064
I'd almost forgotten it myself.

634
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,046
Oh, there's Ed Gage and Hugh Britton,
come to say hello, I guess.

635
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,247
- Welcome home, John.
How are you, Mr. Gage?

636
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,393
A little bit rusty in the joints.

637
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,358
Well, John.

638
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,360
- Good to see you again.
- How are you?

639
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:36,021
Fine, how's the wife and kids?

640
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,224
Just fine, thanks.

641
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:38,425
- Pat?
- Good evening.

642
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,662
- Care for a cigarette?
- I'll just stick to the old pipe.

643
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,708
- Why the gun?
- Never go out without it, son.

644
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,903
Not as things are.

645
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,106
Well, not since
we started the new association.

646
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:56,243
Well, that sounds like business.

647
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,615
Let's call it
a means of staying in business.

648
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,381
You hope.

649
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,489
We're glad you're back, my boy. Maybe you
could help get your dad off the dime.

650
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:07,027
He's gone stubborn on us.
He won't join up.

651
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:09,791
I never did care about carrying a gun.

652
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,060
But you could come along with us
tonight.

653
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,067
Well, just come along and listen.

654
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,763
I've listened for 50 years.
Uh-uh.

655
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,737
Saw Tanner coming out of your office.

656
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:21,901
Yeah, he wanted me to listen, too,
to his side.

657
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,746
You did at one time.

658
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,745
Well, sure, when they needed a lawyer.

659
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,111
They bought my services,
but they didn't buy me.

660
00:41:28,285 --> 00:41:31,083
You gentlemen can buy my services
any time you want.

661
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,517
Mine and John's.

662
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:35,157
We check trust deeds, handle divorces...

663
00:41:35,325 --> 00:41:37,418
...not that you'd be interested in that,
Ed...

664
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:42,224
...but you might be interested
in drawing up a new will.

665
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,828
I told you we'd be wasting our time, Ed.

666
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,230
Better get along.

667
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,461
Hello.

668
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,333
Hello there, Mary Jo.

669
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,530
Hello.

670
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:53,335
Mr. Britton, Mr. Gage,
it's nice to see you again.

671
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,034
Good evening.

672
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,178
John, we're out of baby oil.

673
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:01,010
Okay, I'll go on downtown
and get some.

674
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,379
- Want a ride?
Fine.

675
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:06,353
You'll have to walk back.
All right. I can use the exercise.

676
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,150
I won't be long.

677
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:18,558
Does Mr. Gage always carry a gun?

678
00:42:18,735 --> 00:42:20,532
Sure, guess so. Why not?

679
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,695
He's got a license.

680
00:42:35,285 --> 00:42:36,877
I sure do thank you. Night.

681
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,887
I wish you'd get your dad
to change his mind, John.

682
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,321
Oh, I'm afraid
that would take an act of Congress.

683
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,358
- How about you?
- No.

684
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,189
I've been through one war already.

685
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,921
Good night.

686
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,335
Do me a favor, will you?

687
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,439
Call my mom and tell her I'll be late.

688
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:01,839
That's right.

689
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,254
Who you honking at?

690
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:17,825
You.

691
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,928
Do you mind asking your friends
to get out of the way?

692
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,785
Hey, what's with you? Cut it out.

693
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:52,219
Hey, what is this?

694
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,761
What?

695
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,826
What? Ugh!

696
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:58,229
Let's go.

697
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:15,880
Police. Hey, you, there's a fight.

698
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:24,960
They're killing him.

699
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,289
Do something. Stop them.

700
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,695
Do something. Do something. Stop them!

701
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,399
Hurry.

702
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,271
They aren't hurting each other.

703
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,618
Well, if it ain't my old school chum.

704
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,024
What goes on here?

705
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,225
Let go of me.

706
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:08,098
Don't be so darn smart.
You want me to run you in?

707
00:45:08,272 --> 00:45:11,799
- Yeah, why don't you?
- Some more of your lip, and I will.

708
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,778
Let's get you inside
and wash some of that blood off.

709
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:19,609
Oh, I'm all right, but see how Ed is.

710
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:05,059
Better get a doctor. Here.

711
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:06,559
They play rough.

712
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,392
So let's us play rougher.

713
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:10,658
My name's Bassett.

714
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,096
This is Pat's boy, John.

715
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,736
Oh, glad to know you.

716
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:16,429
Looks like you got more fight in you
than your dad has.

717
00:46:16,606 --> 00:46:19,268
- My dad's done his share of fighting.
- Sure, I know that.

718
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,810
I just wish he'd go along with those of us
who believe in direct action.

719
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,705
Now, me, I'm for going down
to 14th Street right now...

720
00:46:25,882 --> 00:46:27,406
...and putting the torch to it.

721
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,985
I'm not. I don't like vigilantes
any more than my dad does.

722
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:33,418
As soon as I get through
talking over old times...

723
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:36,024
...with an old school chum,
I'll check back with you.

724
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,643
Hey, buddy, how about a drink, huh?

725
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,776
- Fred. Fred Gage.
- When did you get back?

726
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,010
What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?

727
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:05,450
- Waiting for my girl.
- You better get out of here.

728
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,523
Clem Wilson and a couple of other guys
just beat up your dad.

729
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,286
- They what?
- He's over in Gunter's office.

730
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:30,235
Are you looking for someone important,
or will I do?

731
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,314
I'm looking for Clem Wilson.

732
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:34,177
Oh.

733
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,042
Behind those drapes.

734
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,811
Thank you.

735
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,932
I've beat up lots of soldiers.

736
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,001
This is my first chance at a major.

737
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:02,702
Judy.
- John.

738
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,279
Judy, put the floor show on.

739
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,348
Put the floor show on.

740
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,044
Leave him alone.
Keep the civilians out of this.

741
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,986
Fred, get out of here,
this fight is none of your affair.

742
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:18,093
Yes, it is, Ellie.
Go on back and trim your suckers.

743
00:48:18,261 --> 00:48:20,729
Keep those civilians
back in there, all right?

744
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,559
Hey, everybody, come on,
you're gonna miss the strip.

745
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,237
Floor show on. Striptease starting.

746
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,466
- Rhett, aren't you gonna stop him?
- Nope.

747
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:33,836
Why not?

748
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,409
That's young Patterson.

749
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,015
Do you want to invite his dad
to go in with Gage's bunch?

750
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,688
Rhett, I think you ought to stop him.

751
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,350
Relax, Cassie.

752
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:16,313
Nice work, major.

753
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,078
Good work, major.

754
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,186
John, John, that was wonderful.
Are you all right?

755
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,924
I thought I told you to get out of here.

756
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:52,117
- We'd better get out of here, Mr. Patterson.
- Zeke.

757
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:54,752
Yeah, I reckon we'd better.

758
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,647
Thanks again, Zeke. We'll find you a job,
so don't go back to 14th Street.

759
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:27,619
I sure won't.

760
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:32,160
- And thanks, sir, good night.
- Good night.

761
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,191
- That goes for you too.
- I know, I won't go back.

762
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,390
l... I've made up my mind to that.

763
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,467
I made up my mind to something too.

764
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,126
Let's go.

765
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,612
Dad?

766
00:50:58,888 --> 00:51:02,346
- John, what have they done to you?
- It's all right, looks worse than it is.

767
00:51:02,525 --> 00:51:04,618
- You're all bloody.
- I caught one on the nose.

768
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:06,523
- Who did it?
- An old school chum.

769
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,994
What's the matter?
Walk into the drugstore door?

770
00:51:09,165 --> 00:51:11,395
- We're going to that meeting.
- Do no such thing.

771
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,433
Go on back to bed, now. Go on.

772
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,401
John,
we ought to get out of this awful town.

773
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,541
Why? Why should we?

774
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,108
It's my town and Dad's.
We'll do something about it.

775
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:23,108
- What's that?
- I'll tell you on the way.

776
00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:26,077
You go on, go on back to bed.
I'll see you later, good night.

777
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,480
John, I don't want you to go.

778
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:59,308
- It's Pat.
- Yeah, it's Pat.

779
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,885
Dad, you all right?
I'm okay.

780
00:52:03,053 --> 00:52:07,422
If you've come to deliver that lecture about
mob violence, you're wasting your breath.

781
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,319
We got a plan of action.

782
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:12,086
Yeah, well, I haven't.
It's John that wants to talk.

783
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:13,791
So you got it too?

784
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:16,431
You... You should have seen what he did
to Clem Wilson.

785
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:18,430
I just wanna say this.

786
00:52:18,601 --> 00:52:22,935
You've underestimated the intelligence
and the decency of the voters in this state.

787
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:26,200
- How long since you visited the state house?
Or city hall?

788
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:30,676
All right, all right, I'm naive,
but I still have faith in that ballot box.

789
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,181
Next election day,
just watch them being stuffed like turkeys.

790
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:37,114
Let me just tell you something.

791
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,586
Let me just give you the first quotation
my dad ever taught me.

792
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,190
To wit:

793
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:46,761
"The only thing necessary for the triumph
of evil is that good men do nothing."

794
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:49,694
This doesn't apply to any of you,
heaven knows you've tried.

795
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,731
But it does apply to the Alabama voters.

796
00:52:51,901 --> 00:52:54,665
They're the ones we've gotta turn to
to clean this mess up.

797
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,601
Go on, tell us how.

798
00:52:56,773 --> 00:53:00,641
All right, who's the most powerful
law enforcement officer in this state?

799
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:04,211
I know who's supposed to be,
the attorney general.

800
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,371
So let's concentrate on that office.

801
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:11,213
Let's find a man that we can elect
and trust him to do that job.

802
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,257
Oh, if you're thinking of running me,
stop right now.

803
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,295
I'm too poor a risk.

804
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:26,731
Campaigning across 97 counties
is too big a job for a man of my age.

805
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,393
You're not old, Pat.

806
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:30,038
No, not as men go.

807
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:33,767
But I'm stiff in the joints,
I got a bum leg.

808
00:53:33,943 --> 00:53:36,537
I can't even put on
my own pants and shoes.

809
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,840
You'll have plenty of help
to put them on.

810
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,115
Yeah, but what about the voters?

811
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,515
Most of them don't know
what goes on here.

812
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:47,178
Even in Phenix City, they don't.

813
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,985
You tell ordinary people like the man
on the corner...

814
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,991
...or the housewife in the market.

815
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:54,630
You tell them
that a one-block bunch of honky-tonks...

816
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:58,234
...represents one of the most powerful
vice organizations in the States...

817
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,891
...they'll laugh in your face.

818
00:54:00,069 --> 00:54:02,299
The voters sent you to the Senate,
didn't they?

819
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,667
In spite of the organization.

820
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,868
Yeah, and that same organization
beat me on two other occasions.

821
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,741
They're richer.
They'd spend a fortune to beat me again.

822
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,611
- But things can't go on as they are.
- Can't they?

823
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:17,446
You and your dream world, Jeb.

824
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,884
What's the use of starting
a fight you can't win?

825
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:21,250
Why, of course we can win.

826
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,119
How? By appealing to the courts?

827
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,557
By asking the state house
to send out the militia?

828
00:54:25,728 --> 00:54:28,390
It's like shouting at a whirlwind,
nobody listens.

829
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,958
There are enough decent men here
to wipe 14th Street off the map...

830
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:33,568
...if you'll tell them to.

831
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:34,896
Ed, I won't.

832
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:38,632
- But you saw what they did to these two?
- Sure I did, what's new about it?

833
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:42,403
People have been beat up before,
they've been killed, tossed in the river.

834
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,343
Going on since we were born,
it will go on after we're dead.

835
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,746
- Why that's defeatist talk, Dad.
- Sure it's defeatist, I am defeatist.

836
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:51,978
I started talking reform
back as far as '48.

837
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,850
I fought and I lost.

838
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:56,719
- And I'm not gonna fight again.
- Well, I will.

839
00:54:56,893 --> 00:55:00,090
I'm sorry, Dad, but I don't agree
with one word you've said.

840
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:02,663
We're gonna win if it kills us.

841
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:08,400
Yeah, it could do just that.

842
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:15,237
Well, good night.

843
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:56,518
Hi, Mr. Tanner.
- Hi.

844
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,211
- Barton inside?
- Yes, sir.

845
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,956
Hi, Barton.

846
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,727
- Jim, Harry.
- Hello, Rhett.

847
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,092
Well, what's the dope?

848
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,062
Hey, where's?

849
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,435
Hello, Jeb.

850
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,275
- Well, did they tell you?
I just came in.

851
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,036
Well, who was there?

852
00:56:23,212 --> 00:56:25,043
- That Gage, of course.
Mm-hm.

853
00:56:25,214 --> 00:56:26,613
Britton.

854
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,375
Bentley.

855
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,610
Al Patterson.

856
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,415
- Pat?
- He came with his son.

857
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:37,047
- So Pat's gone in with them, has he?
- That's just what he hasn't.

858
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:41,590
He said he wouldn't join in a fight
he couldn't win.

859
00:56:41,764 --> 00:56:43,561
Well, Pat's a good boy.

860
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:47,464
But maybe it was a good thing
I did have that little talk with him yesterday.

861
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,738
Been better if you'd talked with the boy.

862
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,500
- With John?
- He has gone in with them, Rhett.

863
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,734
Could be he'll even head the group.

864
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,505
- Young Patterson?
- He's a fighter, Rhett.

865
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,377
And the Patterson name means more
than all the rest of them put together.

866
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:04,452
- There could be trouble.
- We don't want trouble.

867
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,418
It does not make me happy...

868
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:09,185
...nor anyone else.

869
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,884
It won't make anyone else happy up top,
either.

870
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,426
Do you wanna know something?

871
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,291
That boy's no crumb.

872
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:20,368
It's my bet he'll work on his dad
till Al Patterson runs for attorney general.

873
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:21,935
Attorney general?

874
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:26,303
Why, do you think Pat would have a chance
of winning if he did run?

875
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,637
I'm not doing the thinking.

876
00:57:28,811 --> 00:57:32,144
Oh, if people
would only mind their own...

877
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,981
- How do you figure it, Barton?
- I don't like it.

878
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:39,053
Young Patterson's a smart lad.

879
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:41,690
Yeah, yeah, I know.

880
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,452
I'm just wondering how smart.

881
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,322
Well...

882
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:50,588
...let's give him the full test.

883
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,184
Ain't you Zeke Ward's kid?

884
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,799
Mommy, Mommy!

885
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:29,369
Mommy!

886
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,117
Hey, Dad, see if that kid's all right.

887
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:01,859
There on the lawn, Mommy.

888
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,337
There it is, there it is.

889
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,939
John!

890
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:19,986
Mommy.

891
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,087
Mommy.

892
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,033
Who is she?

893
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,178
Zeke's baby.

894
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,145
Did they kill her just for this?

895
00:59:47,316 --> 00:59:49,910
They've killed for less.

896
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:08,026
Mommy.
- Don't cry, Johnnie, just don't cry.

897
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,968
Everything is gonna be all right.
It's got to be.

898
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:14,598
I said, get out here and get here quick,
or I'll be down there with a gun.

899
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,372
- Now, I mean it.
- Okay, I'll send somebody right over.

900
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,445
Somebody just threw a dead nigger kid
on Patterson's lawn.

901
01:00:21,617 --> 01:00:23,175
Go out and have a look.

902
01:00:31,727 --> 01:00:33,354
Okay.

903
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:39,868
All right, darling, now just...

904
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:43,164
Please, just calm down.
It's gonna be all right.

905
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:47,537
- John, help me, we gotta get out of here.
- All right, sweetheart, just take it easy.

906
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,871
- Will you listen to me?
- I'm through listening.

907
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,037
Help us get the rest of our things packed.

908
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,877
We'll take the children
to your mother's for a while...

909
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,451
For a while?
What do you mean for a while?

910
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,783
Do you think I'm coming back here?
No, not me, not my children.

911
01:01:00,957 --> 01:01:03,425
Stop it.
Look what you're doing to the children.

912
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:07,085
I'm scared, Daddy,
I wanna go with Mommy.

913
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,197
You go see your grandma
for a few minutes.

914
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,062
- But I'm scared.
- Go on, all right, just go to Grandma.

915
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:15,397
Come on, honey,
now, calm down, no more tears.

916
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:17,869
No, no more tears.

917
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,234
What's there to cry about?

918
01:01:19,408 --> 01:01:22,468
Rockabye baby, go to sleep.

919
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:26,172
- Go to sleep forever.
- Now, stop it, Mary Jo.

920
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:29,483
- Are you gonna stay with us?
- Honey, I can't.

921
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,110
- There's a war on, I can't run away.
- Well, then fight it out without us.

922
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,849
Honey, the kids will be perfectly safe
at your mother's.

923
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,686
Safe? They were safe in Germany.

924
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:41,387
- We should've stayed there like I wanted to.
- All right, why were we safe?

925
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,361
Because we fought and we won.

926
01:01:43,532 --> 01:01:45,397
The good people didn't turn their backs.

927
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:46,762
Well, you won't win here.

928
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,497
It's been like this since you were born
and it's gonna be like this forever.

929
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:51,799
So we're leaving.

930
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,169
But you won't leave.
No, you're so brave.

931
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:55,970
- Don't we mean a thing?
- Yes, honey.

932
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:58,113
Yes, you mean the world to me, but...

933
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:01,876
Well, then take your choice, right now.

934
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,383
Well, Mother's not leaving,
she's staying with Dad.

935
01:02:04,553 --> 01:02:06,248
Well, your mother's not me.

936
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,152
So you can just take us to Georgiana
and leave us there.

937
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:10,485
But you just remember...

938
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,857
...I waited for you through one war
I'm not waiting through another.

939
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,225
Oh, please, don't say that.
I love you, darling.

940
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,857
Well, not enough. Not enough.

941
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:23,963
John.

942
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:25,931
John.

943
01:02:26,942 --> 01:02:29,137
I love you too.

944
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:32,740
But why did we come here?

945
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,283
Why did we have to come here?

946
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,612
- Where's Fred?
I don't know.

947
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,776
When you drove up
I thought it might be him.

948
01:04:17,953 --> 01:04:21,013
His car's down on 14th Street,
there's a ticket on it from this afternoon.

949
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,748
- Dear God.
- What happened?

950
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,552
He chased a car.

951
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,922
It's the car they threw
Zeke Ward's baby out of.

952
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,587
- I've checked everywhere he could be.
- The police?

953
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,097
- They know nothing, that's what they say.
- Go away.

954
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,498
- Go away.
- No, Ellie.

955
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:38,037
- lf anything's happened, it isn't Ellie's fault.
- Yes, it is.

956
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:40,937
Wait. We'll look for him together.

957
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:59,750
We've looked everywhere,
but there's no sign of him.

958
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:01,920
I've got news.
I was gonna call your house.

959
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:03,860
- We've just found the boy.
- Where?

960
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,024
Laying in a ditch, just outside of town.

961
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,364
- Is he...?
- No, Miss Rhodes.

962
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,129
He's unconscious, but still alive.

963
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,934
Pretty bad shape.
Looks like he's been in an accident.

964
01:05:13,108 --> 01:05:15,338
But how could he be,
if he didn't have the car?

965
01:05:15,511 --> 01:05:18,969
He could've been in someone else's car.
We'll find out as soon as he talks.

966
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:21,446
They've located him over to the hospital.

967
01:05:40,302 --> 01:05:42,293
Ellie. Oh, Mr. Gage.

968
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:44,098
I'm so glad you came in.

969
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,707
We've been trying
to get in touch with you.

970
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:50,141
I just can't understand
how such a thing could happen to that boy.

971
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:51,438
Neither can we.

972
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,175
- We want to see him as soon as possible.
- Of course you do.

973
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,512
There's just one formality.

974
01:05:57,686 --> 01:05:59,745
You know the red tape in a hospital.

975
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:02,686
Where do you want us to send the body?

976
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:05,088
To what mortuary?

977
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:10,888
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Forgive me, I thought you knew.

978
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:16,431
You see, he was dead on arrival.

979
01:06:26,348 --> 01:06:28,543
I tell you, it was murder,
no question about it.

980
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:30,810
They killed that boy
because he saw the car.

981
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:32,146
You could be right, John.

982
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,848
Well, all right, do you still say
we shouldn't stick our necks out?

983
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:43,161
Well, I've been a lawyer all my life.
I guess I'm still one.

984
01:06:48,737 --> 01:06:51,137
You may proceed, Mr. Patterson.

985
01:06:51,307 --> 01:06:53,138
Thank you, Mr. Coroner.

986
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:56,904
All right,
it was you who found Fred Gage's body?

987
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:58,103
That's right, sir.

988
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,712
It's the coroner's opinion that
Fred Gage died of a fracture of the skull...

989
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,750
...caused by a fall from a speeding car.

990
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,445
- Do you agree with that opinion?
- Yes, sir.

991
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:11,923
What was the nature of the ditch
in which you found him?

992
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:15,461
Well, it was just a roadside ditch,
like any other ditch.

993
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:18,566
Well, would you say
it was a rough, rocky ditch...

994
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,760
...in which a violent fall could cause
a fracture of the skull?

995
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,063
I sure would, sir.

996
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,278
Here's a photograph of that ditch.

997
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,470
Do you recognize it?

998
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,139
Why, yeah, I guess I do.

999
01:07:35,317 --> 01:07:37,376
Why, you need glasses.

1000
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,612
It borders the Coulter Sawmill property.

1001
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:43,815
And as you can see, it's filled
with sawdust, not a rock within a mile.

1002
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:46,894
As soft as any bed in town,
softer than most.

1003
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:53,695
Gentlemen, Fred Gage's skull was fractured
before he was flung into that ditch.

1004
01:07:56,705 --> 01:08:00,766
I conclude you believe
you can prove this assertion, Mr. Patterson?

1005
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,571
I'm not given to wasting breath, sir.

1006
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,611
I'd like to call Clem Wilson.

1007
01:08:07,182 --> 01:08:08,945
Clem Wilson.

1008
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:15,221
- Verdict in?
- Not yet, Mr. Tanner.

1009
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,704
You're Clem Wilson?
I sure am, sir.

1010
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,241
You work at the Poppy Club
on 14th Street?

1011
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:36,571
Yeah.

1012
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:39,111
Did you know Fred Gage?

1013
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:40,977
I've seen him around.

1014
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,550
When did you see him last?

1015
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:45,643
That'd be four nights ago.

1016
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,415
When you were fighting with my son?

1017
01:08:49,858 --> 01:08:52,725
When your son come in the club
and slugged me.

1018
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:56,631
Do you have a car?
Yeah.

1019
01:08:56,799 --> 01:09:00,166
Did you drive that car by my house
and throw a body from it?

1020
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,094
Not me.

1021
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,068
I got nothing against niggers,
as long as they behave.

1022
01:09:07,242 --> 01:09:09,608
Then you didn't see Fred
following that car?

1023
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,009
I did not. How would I, if I wasn't there?

1024
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:16,242
Yesterday you missed
a rear seat cushion from your car.

1025
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,716
Yeah, somebody stole it.

1026
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,758
Is this it?

1027
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,195
I don't know.

1028
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:41,502
The cover has been identified
by the man from whom you bought it.

1029
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,341
Yeah, I reckon that's it.

1030
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:51,077
You can charge me with the theft.
I instigated it.

1031
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:56,219
If it please you, Mr. Coroner, I'd like to call
one more witness, Mr. James Kirby.

1032
01:09:56,391 --> 01:09:57,619
Mr. James Kirby.

1033
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,988
You're dismissed, Wilson.

1034
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,633
Will you please tell the coroner's jury
who you are?

1035
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:18,007
James Kirby, in charge of the laboratory
of the Birmingham Police Department.

1036
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,149
Did you analyze the stains
on this seat cover?

1037
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:23,443
- I did, sir.
- What are they?

1038
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,246
It was human blood, sir.

1039
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,615
- Could you name the blood type?
- Yes, sir.

1040
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,724
It is type B positive.

1041
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:33,328
Is that the same type of blood
that stained the clothing of Fred Gage?

1042
01:10:33,495 --> 01:10:34,519
It is, sir.

1043
01:10:34,696 --> 01:10:36,163
Thank you, Mr. Kirby.

1044
01:10:36,331 --> 01:10:39,095
- No more witnesses, Mr. Coroner.
- You're dismissed.

1045
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,586
- You have reached your verdict, gentlemen?
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,991
What is your verdict?

1047
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:14,761
After due deliberation, our verdict is that
the death of the deceased was accidental.

1048
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:29,982
They were scared to death.

1049
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,750
Can you blame them?

1050
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,911
Let's get out of here.

1051
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:54,541
Pat.

1052
01:11:55,410 --> 01:12:00,279
Well, looked like you had a point
there for a minute about Clem Wilson.

1053
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:03,077
Except Clem never left the club,
I remember it.

1054
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,482
You have a convenient memory, Rhett.

1055
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:07,554
Too bad about young Gage.

1056
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:11,853
I was thinking,
we could get up sort of a fund.

1057
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,052
Ed Gage doesn't need money.

1058
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:16,595
But he was a nice kid.

1059
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:18,357
Used to come into the club.

1060
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,934
I remember thinking
he was kind of sweet on one of our helpers.

1061
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,800
Rhett, you may as well know
something now as later.

1062
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,270
I've changed my mind.

1063
01:12:26,441 --> 01:12:28,432
- About what?
- I'm gonna fight you.

1064
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,135
I'm gonna put you and all those others
out of business.

1065
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,709
Wait a minute, you're upset, Pat.
You're saying more than you mean.

1066
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,546
I'm running
for attorney general of Alabama.

1067
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:56,834
I wonder why my bum leg always twitches
when I make up my mind.

1068
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:59,635
<i>The decision had been made.</i>

1069
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:02,436
<i>From here in it was war.</i>

1070
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:06,240
<i>I took Mary Jo and the children to safety
at her mother's home in Georgiana.</i>

1071
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,212
You go to sleep.

1072
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:12,911
Well, I'll call you every night.
You keep smiling, huh?

1073
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:15,955
- Can't I come with you?
- No.

1074
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:18,852
No, somebody's gotta
look after your mama.

1075
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,654
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

1076
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,798
John, for the last time,
please won't you stay here?

1077
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,558
Now, change your mind.

1078
01:13:25,734 --> 01:13:27,998
Honey, I can't do that.
I've got a job to do.

1079
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:30,468
But I'm so afraid for you.

1080
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:33,506
You know I came through one scrap
where they played for keeps.

1081
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:36,303
That's what I mean, John.
These men play for keeps too.

1082
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:37,911
Don't you worry about it.

1083
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,049
In a year's time,
we'll have forgotten all about this.

1084
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,683
So I'll be seeing you and you...

1085
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,014
You just keep your fingers crossed
and everything will be fine.

1086
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,348
Okay?

1087
01:13:47,522 --> 01:13:50,047
Bye. Bye.

1088
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:51,556
John.

1089
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,155
Wait for me, I'm going with you.

1090
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,489
Why, you can't do that.

1091
01:13:55,664 --> 01:13:58,098
Do you really think
I'd let you go back there alone?

1092
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:01,292
You can't come back with me.
You know how rough those boys play.

1093
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:03,995
Then it will be rough for both of us,
I don't care.

1094
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:06,663
But at least we'll be together.

1095
01:14:07,676 --> 01:14:11,612
Right now I love you more
than I've ever loved you before.

1096
01:14:29,831 --> 01:14:31,731
<i>I'd said they'd play it rough.</i>

1097
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,528
<i>Well,
that was the understatement of all time.</i>

1098
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:39,072
<i>For this is how Dad's campaign began,
to get more violent every day.</i>

1099
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:46,010
<i>Men who had the courage to defend him
were beaten half to death in broad daylight.</i>

1100
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:52,480
No, no!

1101
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,546
No.

1102
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:01,628
<i>And they didn't stop with men.</i>

1103
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:06,924
<i>When the free press cried out,
they tried to silence it.</i>

1104
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:11,838
<i>When a parson raised his voice,
they tried to drown it out.</i>

1105
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:15,036
<i>But they didn't stop Dad.</i>

1106
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:17,405
<i>He limped across the state of Alabama...</i>

1107
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:21,879
<i>...telling the bitter truth in the cities
and villages of 67 counties.</i>

1108
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,881
<i>He was no spellbinder.</i>

1109
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:27,249
<i>His speech
was that of a plain and simple man.</i>

1110
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,889
<i>But the people listened.</i>

1111
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:31,457
<i>Because they were sick of lies.</i>

1112
01:15:31,626 --> 01:15:35,926
Now,
it's not easy and it's not pleasant...

1113
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:42,128
...to tell people such things exist
right in one's own hometown.

1114
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:46,134
For many years...

1115
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:50,707
...my friends and I
have been gathering evidence...

1116
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:56,476
...that will convict and condemn
the murderers of Phenix City.

1117
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:59,484
As well as other peddlers of vice.

1118
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:05,159
<i>That night in Phenix City,
they tried to destroy the evidence...</i>

1119
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,091
<i>...by a fire of unknown origin,
to quote the police report.</i>

1120
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,755
<i>The rule of the mob regarding evidence
If it's human, kill it.</i>

1121
01:16:11,933 --> 01:16:14,834
<i>If it's on paper, burn it up.</i>

1122
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,665
But we still had friends even then.

1123
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:21,305
<i>There was Ellie Rhodes.
Still working at Rhett Tanner's Poppy Club.</i>

1124
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,671
<i>Her bright eyes always watching.</i>

1125
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:27,576
<i>Only Dad and I knew that she'd kept on
with her job in the hope of helping us.</i>

1126
01:16:28,416 --> 01:16:30,077
<i>Then there was Hugh Bentley.</i>

1127
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:36,418
My friends, I bring you news from hell.

1128
01:16:36,591 --> 01:16:40,755
On election day,
the will of the people will decide...

1129
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:46,196
...if corruption or law and order
is to rule our lives.

1130
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:50,270
For though this thing began
in the city I call my home...

1131
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:55,375
...it could not exist
without the secret support of men...

1132
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:58,035
...in our state government.

1133
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:04,710
<i>The shame of it is unparalleled
in the history of our country.</i>

1134
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:07,218
<i>The only way to keep that plague
out of your home...</i>

1135
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:09,584
Mom,
I wonder if Dad thinks we're watching.

1136
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:13,387
<i>and destroy it at its evil source.</i>

1137
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:19,967
<i>The men who are responsible for this evil
are efficient because they are organized.</i>

1138
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,397
They are effective...

1139
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:27,441
<i>...because you and I have failed
in our duty as citizens.</i>

1140
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:31,443
<i>We need the help
of every decent citizen...</i>

1141
01:17:31,613 --> 01:17:35,879
<i>...to save our state
from this deadly danger.</i>

1142
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:42,186
I'm glad to see
some of you had the guts...

1143
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:45,758
...to come out here tonight
and listen to me.

1144
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,890
It needed guts too.

1145
01:17:49,064 --> 01:17:51,897
After what they did
to Hugh Bentley's home.

1146
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,268
Now, I chose this place...

1147
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:59,768
...because I wanted you
to face the cesspool...

1148
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:03,374
...that has given your city the name
of Sin Town, U.S.A.

1149
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:06,139
I wanted you to smell the stench of it.

1150
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:10,951
On more than one election day,
you could have cleaned it up.

1151
01:18:11,653 --> 01:18:15,783
By voting against the candidates
that were sponsored by the mob.

1152
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:19,922
But you wouldn't take
the trouble to vote.

1153
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:23,028
So now you can blame yourselves
for gambling...

1154
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,029
...prostitution...

1155
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,430
...dope peddling, rape.

1156
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,968
Men, women and children murdered.

1157
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,403
Offices burned and homes bombed.

1158
01:18:34,009 --> 01:18:35,874
And where does this happen?

1159
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:39,104
In some dictatorship across the sea?

1160
01:18:39,281 --> 01:18:40,771
No.

1161
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:43,247
It's right here, in your town.

1162
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,649
In our Alabama, our America.

1163
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,487
Did I say your town? Well, that's a laugh.

1164
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,194
Phenix City is owned, body and soul...

1165
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,762
...by Tanner, Jenkins, Drew,
and the rest of the mob.

1166
01:18:56,931 --> 01:19:01,061
They hold the power of life and death
over you and your families.

1167
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,768
Many of them are here tonight.

1168
01:19:03,938 --> 01:19:06,532
There's Rhett Tanner,
the big boss, right there.

1169
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,667
There's Jenkins, Clem Wilson and Rupe.

1170
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,507
They're here to find out
who's against them.

1171
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,242
So now's your chance to speak out.

1172
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,352
And let them know where you stand.

1173
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,886
Or are we gonna wait
till all of us are blown sky high?

1174
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:24,554
Tell them. Tell them now.

1175
01:19:24,726 --> 01:19:26,887
Tell them where you stand.

1176
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:42,069
Go, go get out of here. Go.

1177
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,306
<i>This was Phenix City on election day.</i>

1178
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,915
<i>My dad asked the state house
to proclaim martial law.</i>

1179
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,177
<i>And others asked,
but there wasn't any answer.</i>

1180
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:54,481
<i>So the day was like all other
election days all over the years.</i>

1181
01:19:55,623 --> 01:19:58,421
<i>Strong-arm boys were out in force
to keep in line citizens...</i>

1182
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,619
<i>...who thought they had a right
to vote for whom they pleased.</i>

1183
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:07,234
<i>While votes were bought and sold,
and sex was often used in lieu of money.</i>

1184
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,933
<i>But it was no guarantee you could vote.</i>

1185
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:14,307
<i>No one who voted for Albert Patterson
was guaranteed that right.</i>

1186
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,740
<i>And where were the police?</i>

1187
01:20:16,911 --> 01:20:18,310
<i>On duty.</i>

1188
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,607
<i>Keeping a sharp eye on things.</i>

1189
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,247
Come on, let's go. Come on, everybody.

1190
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,614
<i>When the polls closed,
the mob celebrated.</i>

1191
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:30,246
<i>For once, in every joint,
the good alcohol was on the house.</i>

1192
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:34,122
<i>But they should have waited
to hear from the rest of Alabama.</i>

1193
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,667
What do you know?

1194
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:42,928
A bare thousand votes.

1195
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,937
He won that rerun
with a little more than a thousand.

1196
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:47,472
That's still enough.

1197
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,576
Well, he hasn't been sworn in yet.

1198
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:50,938
If he is, come January...

1199
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:54,673
...there will be so many indictments
flying around, we'll think it's snowing.

1200
01:20:54,849 --> 01:20:57,784
Mm-hm. If he is sworn in.

1201
01:20:57,952 --> 01:20:59,943
You talk
like you know something we don't.

1202
01:21:00,121 --> 01:21:04,717
I'm not talking. I got a hunch
there's been too much talking already.

1203
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,794
And you know something?
You're right, Jenkins.

1204
01:21:07,962 --> 01:21:10,487
He hadn't been sworn in yet.

1205
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:15,031
I could be wrong,
but I've had a feeling all evening.

1206
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,034
It's like something's going on.

1207
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,732
People have been coming and going
into Mr. Tanner's office.

1208
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:24,276
Some even came in the back way.
I couldn't see who they were.

1209
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,073
Well, who did you see?

1210
01:21:26,247 --> 01:21:30,240
I saw Mr. Jenkins and Drew
and Clem Wilson, of course.

1211
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:31,646
<i>Anyone else?</i>

1212
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,583
Oh, yeah, Rupe was here.

1213
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:36,588
He's coming back right now.
He's going to Mr. Tanner's.

1214
01:21:36,758 --> 01:21:38,487
Probably nothing to worry about.

1215
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:41,322
<i>- Just keep those bright eyes open.
- Yes, Mr. Patterson.</i>

1216
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,226
You'd better get off that phone.
They can see you too.

1217
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,095
<i>- Yes, Mr. Patterson.
- Thank you, Ellie.</i>

1218
01:22:01,783 --> 01:22:03,774
Anything wrong?
- No.

1219
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:06,648
No. What should be?

1220
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,579
- Where you going?
- Over to the office.

1221
01:22:09,757 --> 01:22:11,850
Be back in an hour or so.

1222
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:17,965
Dad, I heard about your speech
to the Ladies' Club last night.

1223
01:22:18,132 --> 01:22:21,898
You said you didn't believe you stood
a chance in a hundred to be sworn in.

1224
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,628
Oh, did I say that?

1225
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:27,332
It's just that they looked
so darn pleased with themselves.

1226
01:22:27,509 --> 01:22:29,136
I'll see you.

1227
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,709
Okay.

1228
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:10,382
Okay, miss, want my bank roll
before they button up this joint for good?

1229
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,576
Hey, wait a minute.

1230
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,277
Get ready.

1231
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:27,327
He's got them all with him.

1232
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,868
Well, they shouldn't have come here.

1233
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,999
Hey, Rhett.

1234
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,111
Why couldn't you have
talked to me on the phone?

1235
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:41,771
Not this, I couldn't.

1236
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:43,845
It's gotta happen tonight.

1237
01:23:44,018 --> 01:23:46,714
All right, it's gotta be tonight.

1238
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:49,881
Ellie.

1239
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:54,651
There are customers at your table.
What are you doing at that window?

1240
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:04,828
- What is it?
- It was Ellie Rhodes.

1241
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:07,338
I think she saw you with Jeb Bassett.

1242
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:11,103
She sure got out of here real fast.

1243
01:24:22,156 --> 01:24:24,852
<i>Hello?
- Hello, is Mr. Patterson there?</i>

1244
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:29,122
- I've gotta speak to him quickly.
- No, I'm sorry he's not here.

1245
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:32,892
John, it's someone for your father.

1246
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:36,827
Hello? Who is it?

1247
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:39,064
It's Ellie, John.
I wanna speak to your dad.

1248
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,176
Oh, he just went down to the office, Ellie.
He should be there in about five minutes.

1249
01:24:43,344 --> 01:24:47,678
- I can give you his number if you want.
- Thanks, thanks, I'll go there.

1250
01:24:53,821 --> 01:24:55,846
She sounded a little upset.

1251
01:25:28,322 --> 01:25:30,187
No, no!

1252
01:26:05,793 --> 01:26:08,421
Hey, that's Mr. Patterson.

1253
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,158
Who shot you, Mr. Patterson?

1254
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,061
Who shot you?

1255
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,775
Yeah, yeah, Ellie Rhodes.

1256
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:33,352
So you get off your fat behind
and have your boys pick her up.

1257
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,081
We'll find her, Rhett.
- Yeah.

1258
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:37,952
You'd better find her.

1259
01:26:40,228 --> 01:26:41,889
Killed him?

1260
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:48,927
They killed him.

1261
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,230
Oh, God.

1262
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:54,107
- I should have gone with him tonight.
John.

1263
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:56,903
- John.
- I know I should have gone with him.

1264
01:26:57,078 --> 01:27:01,014
- How were you to know?
- I should have gone with him.

1265
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:02,376
Stop.

1266
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,918
Oh, God.

1267
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:08,146
They're taking him across
to the funeral parlor, John, l...

1268
01:27:08,322 --> 01:27:10,790
I think we'd better get over there.

1269
01:27:20,034 --> 01:27:21,331
This is the end of the line.

1270
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:24,266
- Life won't be worth living in this town.
- Has it ever been?

1271
01:27:24,438 --> 01:27:26,303
We've gotta drive them out.

1272
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:29,602
The guts, murdering a man in cold blood
without giving him a chance.

1273
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:32,041
They'll kill us all
if we don't do something now.

1274
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,113
- Heard the news, where's Johnnie?
- Inside.

1275
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:36,443
- Can't believe it, who killed him?
Who'd know?

1276
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:38,517
Somebody ought to.
They say a girl saw it.

1277
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:40,449
What girl?
- So, what are we gonna do?

1278
01:27:40,621 --> 01:27:41,952
Let the law take its course?

1279
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:44,023
- Is that the answer?
- What law?

1280
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:46,752
Up to now
they have killed with impunity.

1281
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:51,092
And the only penalty they've ever paid
is lawyer's fees.

1282
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:53,859
But suppose the man
who killed Pat is caught?

1283
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,332
Indicted, convicted?

1284
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,869
That will never happen.
- But suppose it does?

1285
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,065
What will he get from a jury
packed with his own kind?

1286
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:02,937
A prison term, huh?

1287
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:06,637
On a plea of self-defense
till he buys himself a pardon.

1288
01:28:07,114 --> 01:28:08,911
You think that's impossible?

1289
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:12,450
The only law
the Phenix City mob respects...

1290
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:16,556
...comes out of the muzzle of a gun
and rips them wide open.

1291
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:19,022
And we know the ones to go after.

1292
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,785
- Sure we do.
Yeah.

1293
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:26,322
So I say give them a taste
of their own medicine.

1294
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:29,799
Clean them out, as Pat would say,
"From stem to stern."

1295
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,702
- Let's do it now, tonight.
- Let's go.

1296
01:28:37,778 --> 01:28:39,643
Stop it, stop it.

1297
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,907
Do you think
that mob isn't waiting for you?

1298
01:28:42,083 --> 01:28:44,210
Every dive in town has its gunmen,
you know.

1299
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:46,285
They're just waiting
for what you suggest.

1300
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:50,652
- They killed your father, John.
- Yes, and they'll kill you too.

1301
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:54,226
Innocent people will be shot down
and what good will it do?

1302
01:28:54,395 --> 01:28:57,626
The days of the vigilantes are over,
my dad said that.

1303
01:28:57,798 --> 01:29:01,029
What we need is the good opinion
of decent people all over this state.

1304
01:29:01,202 --> 01:29:03,363
But we won't get it
with riots and bloodshed.

1305
01:29:03,537 --> 01:29:06,472
Oh, no, you're wrong, John.
You're wrong.

1306
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:07,767
Just a minute.

1307
01:29:08,242 --> 01:29:13,373
There's not a man here who wants
the killer of my father more than I do.

1308
01:29:13,714 --> 01:29:16,808
And if the law doesn't find him, I will.

1309
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:23,014
And if the law doesn't take his life,
I promise you I'll do it myself.

1310
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,058
Now, God knows I'm grateful.

1311
01:29:27,728 --> 01:29:29,787
But this is my job, not yours.

1312
01:29:30,064 --> 01:29:31,429
John's right.

1313
01:29:31,599 --> 01:29:34,090
Mr. Patterson,
you're wanted on the telephone.

1314
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:36,498
She says it's urgent. Miss Rhodes.

1315
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,536
All right, I'll be right in.

1316
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,932
Thank you.

1317
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,313
<i>- Hello?
Hello, Mr. Patterson?</i>

1318
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:50,882
- Ellie?
- I saw it, John, I saw them kill your father.

1319
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,987
- Did they see you?
- Yes, I'm sure they did.

1320
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:55,788
Then they'll be after you.

1321
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,289
- Where are you?
- At Zeke Ward's place.

1322
01:29:58,459 --> 01:29:59,824
I just ran out to telephone.

1323
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:01,962
Get back in there
and don't show your face.

1324
01:30:02,129 --> 01:30:04,927
They'll have the police after you,
and heaven knows who else.

1325
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:06,566
- I'll be right down.
- Yes, John.

1326
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,567
<i>Right away, but you get back in there.</i>

1327
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,900
It's Ellie Rhodes, she saw the murderers.

1328
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:19,876
I'm going to Zeke's.
Bring Bentley and the others, follow me.

1329
01:30:20,047 --> 01:30:22,345
- Sure thing, Johnny.
- I'll see you at Zeke's.

1330
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:33,317
<i>Hello?</i>

1331
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,088
- Rhett, it's Jeb.
- Yeah, yeah, Jeb?

1332
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:38,424
Rhett,
John's on his way to Zeke Ward's house.

1333
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,430
You're nearer, you can get there first.

1334
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,627
Who cares about Zeke Ward?
I want Ellie Rhodes.

1335
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:45,931
That's just it, Rhett. She's there.

1336
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:49,765
She's at Zeke Ward's.

1337
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:19,704
Ellie?

1338
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:27,847
Ellie?

1339
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:41,794
Zeke?

1340
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:37,712
Ellie.

1341
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,147
Ellie. Where's Ellie?

1342
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,514
Down below.

1343
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:42,383
- Mr. Tanner went there.
- Where?

1344
01:32:42,556 --> 01:32:44,524
Back porch cellar.

1345
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:36,633
No, Zeke!

1346
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:00,932
You killed my dad.
- No.

1347
01:34:01,101 --> 01:34:03,126
It was you.
- No, no.

1348
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,272
You're lying. You gave the orders.

1349
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:10,706
No, I killed Ellie. John, l...
I didn't kill your dad.

1350
01:34:11,378 --> 01:34:12,538
No, Mr. Patterson.

1351
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:15,045
Don't do it, Mr. Patterson,
please don't do it.

1352
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:17,650
If your father was here now,
he'd say the same thing.

1353
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:19,786
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

1354
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:23,014
- He killed Ellie.
- That don't make it right to kill him.

1355
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:26,648
Listen, back there a few minutes ago,
I was gonna beat a man's brains out.

1356
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:30,285
I was gonna take his body,
throw it out of a car like he did my girl.

1357
01:34:30,464 --> 01:34:32,728
But my wife, she took my arm,
and she said, "No."

1358
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,924
Get away.

1359
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:37,195
Please, Mr. Patterson. No, don't do it.

1360
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:40,568
Listen to me, she said,
"The Lord said not to kill.

1361
01:34:40,741 --> 01:34:42,902
'Thou shalt not kill,' the Lord said."

1362
01:34:43,077 --> 01:34:46,604
Mr. Patterson, please.
Please, Mr. Patterson.

1363
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:49,806
"Thou shalt not kill," the Lord said.

1364
01:34:50,918 --> 01:34:52,442
And I stood there looking at her.

1365
01:34:52,620 --> 01:34:55,487
She was crying
and all bloody where he'd beat her.

1366
01:34:55,656 --> 01:34:57,647
And I was gonna do it anyway.

1367
01:34:57,825 --> 01:35:00,794
But she said, "No, Zeke, no.

1368
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:03,486
We been fighting against things like this.

1369
01:35:03,664 --> 01:35:09,000
All our lives we been fighting against people
taking the law into their own hands."

1370
01:35:09,803 --> 01:35:12,897
So l... I handed her the gun.

1371
01:35:13,073 --> 01:35:15,041
And I come out here.

1372
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,409
Thanks, Zeke.

1373
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:52,510
Don't kill anybody.

1374
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:54,671
Come on, Mr. Patterson.

1375
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:05,449
John, what goes on? Where were you?

1376
01:36:05,626 --> 01:36:07,093
What?

1377
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:11,125
John, why? What happened?

1378
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:14,358
I'll tell you what happened,
but there's something else first.

1379
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:24,568
Hello? Give me the State Capitol,
it's an emergency.

1380
01:36:27,514 --> 01:36:28,913
Now, look, don't...

1381
01:36:29,083 --> 01:36:31,711
Just a minute now,
don't give me any more arguments.

1382
01:36:31,885 --> 01:36:35,651
This is an emergency.
I want him on there and I want him on fast.

1383
01:36:38,792 --> 01:36:40,282
All right, hold it.

1384
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:41,792
You just hold it.

1385
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,589
Now, just hold it.

1386
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:47,359
Come on up here.
Come on in close, I need your voices.

1387
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:51,830
Now, before you say no again,
I want you to listen.

1388
01:36:52,005 --> 01:36:53,802
You've got to listen.

1389
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:56,135
You want this city cleaned up?

1390
01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:59,006
Well, let the State Capitol hear
the voice of Phenix City.

1391
01:36:59,179 --> 01:37:00,339
Shout so he can hear it.

1392
01:37:09,656 --> 01:37:12,523
By tomorrow morning,
when they hear about my father's death...

1393
01:37:12,693 --> 01:37:16,629
...you'll hear 10,000 times that sound,
the voice of Alabama.

1394
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,628
Now, will you send us help?

1395
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:20,960
Yeah, yeah!

1396
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:31,001
Thank you.

1397
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,942
They're sending the militia.

1398
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:40,476
Tomorrow Phenix City
will be under martial law.

1399
01:37:45,058 --> 01:37:48,391
<i>The law came to Phenix City at last.</i>

1400
01:37:49,997 --> 01:37:52,488
<i>It took my father's death to bring it.</i>

1401
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:56,725
<i>It wasn't the kind of law
my father fought and died for.</i>

1402
01:37:56,904 --> 01:38:00,362
<i>But it was the only law
the men who killed him could understand.</i>

1403
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,806
<i>The law with a loaded gun in its hand.</i>

1404
01:38:03,977 --> 01:38:05,842
<i>The gamblers' men obeyed it.</i>

1405
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,846
<i>They had no choice but to obey.</i>

1406
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:13,245
<i>The doors through which the suckers
thronged were locked.</i>

1407
01:38:40,614 --> 01:38:44,380
<i>The devices that cheated them
were broken up and burned.</i>

1408
01:38:44,551 --> 01:38:46,951
<i>But how long would it last?</i>

1409
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:53,523
<i>The evil men who had ruled our lives
for so long were still out there.</i>

1410
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:56,128
<i>Waiting their moment to come back.</i>

1411
01:38:56,296 --> 01:39:00,630
<i>We'd won a battle,
but had we won the war?</i>

1412
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:06,639
<i>That is the question that I, John Patterson,
and all of our good friends had to consider.</i>

1413
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:12,308
The people of Alabama elected me
attorney general in my father's place.

1414
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,346
With two sacred duties to perform:

1415
01:39:15,682 --> 01:39:20,051
To seek out and bring to justice
the murderers of my father...

1416
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:24,919
...and to keep the gambling hells
of Phenix City firmly closed forever.

1417
01:39:26,159 --> 01:39:30,220
With God's help, I shall not fail.
