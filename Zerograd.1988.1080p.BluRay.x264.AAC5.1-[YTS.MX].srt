00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:46,274
Will you drive me to the hotel?

10
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:21,744
Take a look. There should
be a pass here... for Varakin.

11
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:35,172
What? Nothing? But it can't be. I
just ordered it, take a look again.

12
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,764
No pass for you.

13
00:05:41,817 --> 00:05:43,888
Damn.

14
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:02,001
Hello, this is Varakin. I am at the
guard house and there is no pass for me.

15
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,984
I have explained it to you
already half an hour ago.

16
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:12,214
I am Varakin from Moscow factory. I am here on
the business trip regarding the air conditioners.

17
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,919
well, you supply us
with the conditioners...

18
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:23,165
all right, all right. I am waiting.

19
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,760
Chaos...

20
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:34,124
<i>Yes, got it. Comrade Varakin, you may pass.</i>

21
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:02,144
'Director'

22
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,276
Hello.

23
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:29,899
Ninochka, into order right a way, I
have talked with Pal Palich already.

24
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,568
What question do you have?

25
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,849
So what question do you have?

26
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:55,312
I am from the Moscow factory...
regarding the conditioners.

27
00:07:55,857 --> 00:07:57,328
I'll announce you.

28
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,277
Pal Palich, there is a member
of Moscow factory here.

29
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,292
<i>Let him in.</i>

30
00:08:04,164 --> 00:08:06,234
Please, enter.

31
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,098
I am listening to you.

32
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:43,822
I am listening.

33
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,623
You see... I am from the Moscow
factory... Our director has phoned you.

34
00:08:56,624 --> 00:09:03,297
It is regarding the air
conditioners you supply us with.

35
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,792
We supply you with the air conditioners?

36
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:16,971
Well, yes. For 15 years already.

37
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,465
Beautiful. So what else do you want?

38
00:09:25,415 --> 00:09:30,372
We want you to change the back panel.

39
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,302
Why?

40
00:09:37,753 --> 00:09:42,384
Well we operate on a self-supporting basis.
We have changed an entire technology.

41
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,941
And now our panel doesn't match yours.

42
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,937
We have phoned you, sent the blueprints.

43
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:55,730
You asked to send a man to
settle everything on the spot.

44
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:58,536
So I have come.

45
00:09:58,537 --> 00:10:02,813
Well, I think, we will solve this
efficiently. I'll find the chief engineer...

46
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:12,319
Nina, Nina, Nina. Where is she?

47
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:25,475
I am sorry... The thing is that your secretary
there... is sitting absolutely naked.

48
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,689
How naked?

49
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,156
Well, in the nude, completely naked.

50
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,962
In what sense?

51
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:37,758
Literaly.

52
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:43,343
Without any clothes.
She is sitting and typing.

53
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:45,821
Like everything is normal.

54
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,589
What are you saying?

55
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:55,246
Pal Palich. You've been phoned from
Gorlspolkom, ...they asked you to phone.

56
00:10:55,818 --> 00:10:57,017
I have people over.

57
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:01,347
So naked you say?

58
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:03,554
Take a look if you don't believe me.

59
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,796
Yes. She is truly naked.

60
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:32,916
What did we stop on?
Oh yes, the chief engineer.

61
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,625
Nonochka, connect me to the chief engineer.

62
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,375
We don't have him, Pal Palich.

63
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,010
Where is he then?

64
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:47,126
He died.

65
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,216
When?

66
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,676
8 months ago.

67
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:54,597
What do you say?

68
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,758
You see what a misfortune we have.

69
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:02,115
Ninochka, so why did he die?

70
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,894
He drowned in the river.

71
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:13,283
Yeah... Well, your issue
gets more complicated.

72
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:23,252
Let's do this: you'll come
to us... two weeks later,

73
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:29,463
I and the chief engineer will work on this
question... and will solve it efficiently.

74
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:33,549
Deal?

75
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,928
Yes, I have ordered the call.

76
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:19,368
Natasha? I have settled
fine, everything is all right.

77
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,271
Why sick? My voice is normal.

78
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:29,011
I depart today.

79
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:34,105
No. This... I haven't done it. I can't
understand myself, it is true nonsense.

80
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:40,179
Well, I tell you everything when
I come home... It is very funny.

81
00:14:41,568 --> 00:14:45,817
I leave today, see you.

82
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,879
Damn it...

83
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,821
Let's do this without the menu.
Just take my order, I am in hurry.

84
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:05,728
Please.

85
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:09,841
So what do you have for the starters?

86
00:15:10,386 --> 00:15:12,891
Borscht or solyanka...

87
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:13,681
We have solyanka.

88
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:18,094
Solyanka it is. And for the main
course some meat, not very fat.

89
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:19,702
We have fresh beef steak.

90
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,308
Good, steak is fine.

91
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:23,623
mineral water and tea.

92
00:15:24,931 --> 00:15:25,884
What do you want for desert?

93
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,090
Nothing, thank you.

94
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,032
We have fresh cakes.

95
00:15:31,141 --> 00:15:34,791
Thank you, I don't need anything.

96
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:39,749
No more orders. We
have a brake in 10 minutes.

97
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,499
Your tea and desert.

98
00:17:31,234 --> 00:17:32,895
What desert? I haven't ordered anything.

99
00:17:33,358 --> 00:17:37,662
Don't worry, it isn't included in the bill.
It is just a small present from our cook.

100
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,850
What is that?

101
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:49,783
Cake.

102
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:52,566
Eat for your health. Our cook made
it specially for you, he likes you a lot.

103
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,080
There, he is looking out the kitchen.

104
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:08,175
It happens, one person likes
another. Sympathy was born.

105
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,299
Give me the bill.

106
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,404
You just try.

107
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:15,964
I ask you to give me the bill!

108
00:19:15,965 --> 00:19:21,794
Just a slice. Otherwise
our cook will shoot himself.

109
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:32,961
Listen... stop talking nonsense!

110
00:20:05,811 --> 00:20:07,411
So you weren't acquainted with Nikolaev?

111
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:09,651
No.

112
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,464
And you have never met him before?

113
00:20:14,199 --> 00:20:18,421
No, never. It is my
first visit of your town.

114
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:27,301
I have the train late in the evening, so
I came to have dinner and... such story.

115
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:40,294
The waiter Kurdumov says that he warned you that Nikalaev
could kill himself if you refuse to try the cake.

116
00:20:40,402 --> 00:20:47,648
Yes, he warned me, but I didn't worry
about it. Everything seemed so silly.

117
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:51,788
just absurd.

118
00:20:55,656 --> 00:21:06,497
The colleagues describe Nikolaev as a calm, firm person,
activist of Sober community, a great specialist...

119
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:16,820
If only I knew that it will turn this
way... Of cause, I would eat this damn cake.

120
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,396
All right then, sign it
here and you may go.

121
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:39,155
'It is written from my words correctly
and was read by me'. And your signature.

122
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:53,128
We'll call you if we need you.

123
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,362
I need one first class ticket to Moscow.

124
00:22:10,043 --> 00:22:12,086
There are no tickets.

125
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:14,401
I don't care which one,
first or second class...

126
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,581
I have neither of them.

127
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,949
Where is the head of the station?

128
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,628
The head won't help.

129
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,520
Where?

130
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,886
To the nearest train station.

131
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:03,326
That's it, we've arrived. I can't
drive further - see the sign?

132
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,977
Should I turn?

133
00:24:07,685 --> 00:24:09,018
How far is the station?

134
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,961
1,5 kilometer, no more.

135
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,903
I'll walk then.

136
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:17,673
Thank you.

137
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,206
Hello.

138
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:50,923
Good evening.

139
00:26:51,222 --> 00:26:54,572
Could you tell me where
is the station around here?

140
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:59,776
There is no station here. There
is our local-history museum.

141
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,460
But I was told that somewhere
around here there is a station.

142
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,873
There was no any station
here, this is closed area.

143
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:15,682
Would you like to see the display?

144
00:27:18,243 --> 00:27:19,877
Tell me how can I get to the town?

145
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,901
Nohow.

146
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,604
Buses are out of service now.

147
00:27:27,422 --> 00:27:28,920
And how are you going to get there?

148
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:36,383
I live here, in the museum.

149
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:45,781
But if you urgently need the town, there is a lady near
by. Sometimes in the evening she goes to town by her car

150
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:49,103
I can find out if she goes tonight.

151
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,508
Be so kind.

152
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:04,085
Anna? It's me.

153
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:13,536
Do you plan to go to the town tonight? I have a
handsome young man here... Would you take him with you?

154
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,735
Thank you.

155
00:28:16,342 --> 00:28:27,046
Everything is set. An hour later she'll pick you up. And for now
you can take a look at the museum, 30 kopecks for the ticket.

156
00:29:03,354 --> 00:29:04,853
Where are we going?

157
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:11,361
The display is located
at the depth of 28 meters.

158
00:29:11,362 --> 00:29:13,977
Did they dig the mine for
the museum specifically?

159
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:22,067
Of cause, not. In 19 century it was a
coal mine. The workers found an old burial.

160
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:34,842
The local merchant Butov, an archeology fan, has bought out all the
land around and, continuing excavations, has founded the museum.

161
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,776
Please, come in. Where is the light here?

162
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:54,263
The most ancient artifacts which were found on the
territory of our town date from the fall of Troy.

163
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:59,846
In this sarcophagus was buried
one of Trojan kings, Dardan.

164
00:30:01,154 --> 00:30:04,776
Wait, how could Trojans get here?

165
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:13,275
Professor Rottenberg has proven that some
Trojans after Troy has fallen went to the North

166
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:19,758
and after approaching the local lands, they have founded
their first settlement, where our town is now located.

167
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:26,022
Here you see the inscription: 'Dardan
- Gelen's son, Priam's grandson.

168
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:33,159
There are the same words on the shield, which
Butov has discovered beside the sarcophagus.

169
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:35,902
Let's go further.

170
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:47,568
'Our power is in the truth of history.'

171
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:55,031
The second cohort of the
XIVth double Mars' legion.

172
00:30:55,576 --> 00:31:00,123
Wait, you mean these are Romans?

173
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,124
Absolutely correct.

174
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:13,662
This is the cohort, of which disappearance on the way from Britain to
Caucasus, the head of the legion, Titrubriy, was reporting to Neron.

175
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:20,744
The remains of the cohort were discovered by
Butov during the excavation of the second shaft.

176
00:31:21,153 --> 00:31:25,238
What a nonsense. Romans have
never reached the territory of the USSR.

177
00:31:25,701 --> 00:31:33,628
The sculpture portraits were reconstructed by our artist
Igor Rumin following the professor Gerasimov's method.

178
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:37,577
Let's continue the viewing.

179
00:31:39,102 --> 00:31:50,052
Attila's bed, on which the Huns' leader raped
the Vest-Ost's queen with his horde watching him.

180
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:57,679
Professor Rottenberg discovered the remains
of the semen on it. He extracted the DNA,

181
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:07,648
put the data into computer and
created absolutely genuine look of Attila.

182
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:34,553
These are the first people who
danced rock-n-roll in our town.

183
00:32:53,762 --> 00:33:01,770

the Second. Here is the head of the impostor.

185
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:15,008
Where did you get the head from?

186
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:23,724
After Pseudo-Dmitry's death Marina Mnishek ordered to
her doctor Izmail to embalm the head of her husband.

187
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:33,475
Her lover, ataman Zarutskiy, lost the head
playing cards to Polish uhlan Beletskiy.

188
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:40,475
Beletskiy was killed during the siege
of Kremlin by Minin and Pazharskiy.

189
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:48,265
and strelets Fyodor Kuzmin, the
native of our town, has got the head.

190
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:54,830
He isn't here. Let's move further.

191
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:16,866
Here you see Vladimir, prince of Kiev, during him
making a decision of introducing Christianity to Russia.

192
00:34:18,691 --> 00:34:25,009
Famous Russian fighter, the
native of our town, Nikifor Petrov.

193
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,364
He was reported to Tsar's guard by the head
of fighting organization, provocateur Mazepa.

194
00:34:32,664 --> 00:34:36,312
He died at the labor camp...
and this is Mazepa himself.

195
00:34:36,313 --> 00:34:42,279
Here is his lover, the actress N.

Another member of our town - comrade Burtsev,
commandant of 'Florence' hotel in Moscow.

198
00:35:01,318 --> 00:35:06,111
In 1818, the conference of
Anarchists took place here.

199
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:12,512
Here you see comrade Burtsev.
He is entering the door with the pillow.

200
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:21,447
Father Makhno took part in the conference. He is talking to the
commander of Jewish rebellion platoon of his army Abram Shnaider.

201
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:27,875
To the left from him is famous Gavrusha -
the commander of Father's 'black hundred'.

202
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:35,148
who promised to chop up his own
parents if only Father would order.

203
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:43,319

Here you see the apartment of Parfiriy
Kuridze, the worker of the railroad shop.

205
00:35:50,183 --> 00:35:58,627
Here in November of 1904 Stalin spent in our
town one night after his escape from exile.

206
00:35:59,608 --> 00:36:10,536
At the dawn he toasted: "Soon it will be dawn.
The sun will rise. This sun will shine for us."

207
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,975
Zinoviy Peshkov - Gorkiy's adopted son and Sverdlov's
brother, French ambassador in China in 30-tees.

208
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:11,707
And who's this?

209
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:18,136
This is the head of our Writers' Organization,
Vasiliy Chugunov at his country house.

210
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:26,115
He started as a poet. His first poem was
published in 'Ogoniok' in March of 1938.

211
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,221
'The sentence of people'

212
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:36,438
'The guard's bayonets - we are in the October's hall.
The judge's moan, the steel of prosecutor's lines.

213
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:42,785
So how much did you take from Germans
to sell the Motherland so many times?

214
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:48,506
Anger in the eyes flushed and disappeared.
And the defendants don't look at the people.

215
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:54,389
Yes, we blended glass into
butter. Yes, I ordered to kill Gorkiy.

216
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:00,381
I took money for spying.
Terror, betrayal, poison.

217
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:05,256
They sit like trapped beasts,
they speak one after another.

218
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:09,178
Chernov, Yagoda, Rozengoltz, Bukharin.

219
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:12,311
The people's faces disappear.

220
00:38:12,312 --> 00:38:14,790
Monstrous, devil's faces.

221
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:18,058
you see before you.'

222
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:27,130
In 1949 Chugunov was accused in cosmopolitanism
for his historical novel 'Kukhelbekker's shackles'

223
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:32,822
In 1956 he was rehabilitated.

224
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:46,086
The first head of our Revolution Committee, who took
part in killing of the Emperor's family - Mikhail Zverev.

225
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:54,584
Here you see him during the meeting of the workers of
Belomor-Baltic canal with the leaders of the project.

226
00:38:54,585 --> 00:39:01,313
He is with the accordion to the left from
the director of GULAG, comrade Bergman.

227
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:09,048
During this meeting the head
of the project, Yagoda, said:

228
00:39:09,049 --> 00:39:19,317
"The labor camps are pioneers of
the cultural assimilation of our far land."

229
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:17,742
Here is another native of
our town - academician Fomin,

230
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:25,315
who is discussing in 1934 with the
comrades Khrushev and Koganovich

231
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:34,363
the project of the building of Ministery
of Heavy Industry at the Red Square.

232
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:55,168
Major Sokolov - also was born in our town.

233
00:40:56,149 --> 00:41:01,678
In September of 1942 carrying out
the air cover for the British convoy

234
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:06,581
He had a fight with 10 German
fighters. He has destroyed 6 of them

235
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:13,173
and deadly wounded he landed his
plain to the south from Spitsbergen.

236
00:41:24,286 --> 00:41:27,173
Antonina Petukhova,
also known as 'Martishka'.

237
00:41:28,672 --> 00:41:38,585
She is the first citizen of our town who was
arrested during the Youth Festival in Moscow in 1957

238
00:41:38,586 --> 00:41:44,034
for the connection with the foreigners.

239
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:59,369
The composition of our sculptor
Troitskiy with the title 'Dreams'.

240
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:03,340
Please.

241
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,638
Strange... Where is Anna?

242
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,090
I don't get it. She is
usually very punctual.

243
00:44:14,397 --> 00:44:17,093
May be she changed her mind.

244
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:20,443
Well, that is all right.
You can spend night here.

245
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:21,444
Where is 'here'?

246
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:28,343
Our electrician lives very near, they have a big house. You
will spend a night and tomorrow you'll go to the town by bus.

247
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,548
May be it is possible to leave right now?

248
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:35,997
No... Now you won't get out. It
is 15 kilometers to the high way.

249
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:41,335
Let's go, I'll accompany
you and set up your stay.

250
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:11,651
Help your self, help yourself...
How did you manage to end up here?

251
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:12,930
Are you tourist?

252
00:45:12,931 --> 00:45:14,483
No...

253
00:45:14,743 --> 00:45:15,953
Please, help yourself.

254
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:21,729
Thank you... I asked the taxi driver to get
me to the nearest station, he brought me here.

255
00:45:22,192 --> 00:45:28,946
We don't have any station! There is a station in Perebrodino,
and we are 'Perebrodovo', so the taxi drivers mix them up.

256
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,178
Was your taxi driver young?

257
00:45:31,179 --> 00:45:33,875
Hello... young.

258
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,292
Well, this is common thing.

259
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,778
Hostess, you have potatoes there...
they have burnt, probably, already.

260
00:45:39,295 --> 00:45:40,385
I'm going

261
00:45:42,836 --> 00:45:44,387
Would you like to drink?

262
00:45:44,388 --> 00:45:46,594
No, thanks. I don't drink.

263
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:50,161
Homemade...

264
00:46:08,003 --> 00:46:11,897
You will never leave our town.

265
00:46:15,874 --> 00:46:16,910
What?

266
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:26,279
You will never leave this place. You will die
in 2015 and will be buried at the town cemetery.

267
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,469
I see your grave and the tomb stone. The
engraving says "Varakin Alekseiy Mikhailovich'

268
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:44,637
1945-2015. To our beloved father from
daughters: Julia, Natasha, Tamara and Zinaida.'

269
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:54,466
great quality!

270
00:46:57,571 --> 00:47:02,720
What are you doing here? Go to
bed! Time is 22.00 and he is sitting here!

271
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,864
Good night.

272
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,505
Good night.

273
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:17,946
Misha, don't forget to brush your teeth.

274
00:47:22,086 --> 00:47:25,410
Well... to our meeting!

275
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:32,083
Forgive me... Where can I lie down?

276
00:47:32,463 --> 00:47:34,615
Why? You want to bed already?

277
00:47:34,616 --> 00:47:36,929
Forgive me, I am very tired.

278
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,852
But you haven't eaten anything. Try
potatoes at least, they are homegrown.

279
00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:45,592
Thank you, I am sated.
I am simply very tired.

280
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:50,331
I'll show you the way.

281
00:47:50,332 --> 00:47:51,939
Thank you.

282
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,293
Here is the towel. Be comfortable.

283
00:47:59,675 --> 00:48:01,255
Thank you.

284
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:04,551
Who is this?

285
00:48:04,768 --> 00:48:10,625
You know, I don't know. After we have bought the
house Victor found it in the attic and hung here.

286
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:13,485
Good night.

287
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:15,990
Good night.

288
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:43,773
Excuse me. You are being picked up.

289
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:52,053
My name is Anna. Forgive me I couldn't
collect you in the museum - I had a flat tire.

290
00:48:52,244 --> 00:48:56,194
If you didn't change your mind,
I can take you to the town now.

291
00:49:07,552 --> 00:49:10,004
I am sorry, could you
take me to Perebrodino?

292
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:12,128
You need to get to the station?

293
00:49:13,435 --> 00:49:15,397
Yes, I need to get to Moscow.

294
00:49:15,832 --> 00:49:19,782
Two trains stop at Perebrodino:
from Adler and Tbilisi.

295
00:49:21,062 --> 00:49:22,062
Very good.

296
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:26,428
Has something upset you?

297
00:49:28,389 --> 00:49:33,292
Upset? No... I am rather surprised.

298
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,713
Tell me has somebody predicted your future?

299
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:50,316
Mine? No... But I have read that French doctor
Nostradamus predicted Hitler in XVI century.

300
00:49:53,312 --> 00:49:58,515
Somebody is following
us. They signal us to stop.

301
00:50:16,192 --> 00:50:18,263
Comrade Varakin?

302
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:20,496
Yes.

303
00:50:20,932 --> 00:50:23,029
I ask you to get into our car.

304
00:50:25,997 --> 00:50:31,391
We have gotten new information.
Some things have to be cleared up.

305
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,574
Do you recognize this?

306
00:50:39,998 --> 00:50:41,305
It is me.

307
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:51,956
Absolutely right. The photo was found
among the papers of dead cook Nikolaev.

308
00:50:56,041 --> 00:50:59,011
How did he get it?

309
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,532
We would like to know that too.

310
00:51:04,485 --> 00:51:08,898
You told me that you
have never known the cook.

311
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,766
No... never.

312
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:19,031
So how can you explain this: "To
my dear father from Makhmud."?

313
00:51:20,992 --> 00:51:22,599
What, what?

314
00:51:23,906 --> 00:51:29,436
It means that you are cook's son Makhmud.

315
00:51:30,279 --> 00:51:38,260
What nonsense... what son, what Makhmud?

316
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:46,513
The examination has proven that your hand writing
and the writing on the photograph are identical.

317
00:51:54,521 --> 00:52:11,546
Listen, it is some misunderstanding. I have never seen
this cook. My father is Varakin Mikhail... Alekseevich.

318
00:52:12,281 --> 00:52:17,592
He has never been a
cook. He is an engineer!

319
00:52:18,709 --> 00:52:24,783
So how can we explain that the photograph
with your writing was founded at Nikolaev's?

320
00:52:30,094 --> 00:52:32,437
I don't know...

321
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:39,383
But may be you have met the cook before?

322
00:52:39,709 --> 00:52:45,266
Never. I swear to you. Never!

323
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:01,064
I have to make sure
you aren't going to leave.

324
00:53:01,609 --> 00:53:04,061
How can it be? This is a mistake.

325
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:07,847
Don't you worry. We will solve everything.

326
00:53:08,255 --> 00:53:09,399
I have to go to Moscow!

327
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:16,999
I have to make sure you aren't going to
leave. But you can appeal against my actions.

328
00:54:00,144 --> 00:54:01,588
<i>Varakin Aleksey Mikhailovich?</i>

329
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:03,467
Yes.

330
00:54:03,793 --> 00:54:05,537
<i>A public prosecutor is speaking to you...</i>

331
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:06,327
Who?

332
00:54:06,518 --> 00:54:12,565
<i>The public prosecutor of this town. Get
down, there is a car waiting for you there.</i>

333
00:54:28,417 --> 00:54:30,405
Good day, Aleksey Mikhailovich.

334
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:32,830
Hello.

335
00:54:33,919 --> 00:54:35,798
Please.

336
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,297
Thank you.

337
00:54:47,374 --> 00:54:51,297
I am familiar with the case,
regarding witch you wanted to see me.

338
00:54:56,854 --> 00:54:58,515
Strange case...

339
00:54:59,278 --> 00:55:06,360
You see... It is some misunderstanding. I have nothing
to do with that incident, I was there accidentally.

340
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,329
I need to go to Moscow urgently.

341
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:25,018
Aleksey Mikhailovich... have you
ever wanted to commit a crime?

342
00:55:26,516 --> 00:55:27,578
Why?

343
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:37,302
Just because. To commit something illegal. Well,
I don't know... to steal the tape recorder?

344
00:55:38,365 --> 00:55:39,365
To attack a policeman?

345
00:55:42,314 --> 00:55:45,446
Why should I attack a policeman?

346
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:51,438
A policeman is just an
example. Can you imagine...

347
00:55:53,019 --> 00:56:00,100
I, prosecutor, am dreaming
of committing a crime?

348
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:08,872
All my life I punish the
criminals and envy them inside.

349
00:56:10,887 --> 00:56:16,880
Paradox, worthy to be
described by the novelist.

350
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:28,292
Wouldn't it be great to commit something
crazy? Which nobody expects from you.

351
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:45,861
All right... back to our case. So you
want me to let you return to Moscow?

352
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:47,523
Yes!

353
00:56:47,876 --> 00:56:58,690
Aleksey Mikhailovich, doesn't it seem to you that
you were a witness of not suicide, but murder?

354
00:57:00,978 --> 00:57:01,978
What?

355
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:04,465
Murder.

356
00:57:04,928 --> 00:57:07,297
But I have seen myself
when he shot himself...

357
00:57:10,538 --> 00:57:19,908
The thing is that you haven't seen
that. Try to remember how it all happened.

358
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:37,721
Your tea and desert.

359
00:57:37,722 --> 00:57:39,247
What desert? I didn't order anything.

360
00:57:39,438 --> 00:57:44,559
Don't worry, it isn't included in the bill.
It's just a small present from our cook.

361
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:46,901
What's this?

362
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:49,190
Cake.

363
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:02,734
<i>Stop! Why did jazz play?</i>

364
00:58:03,388 --> 00:58:05,921
<i>I don't know... May be
they had a rehearsal?</i>

365
00:58:06,384 --> 00:58:10,633
<i>There is no a jazz band in the
'Dnepr' restaurant and never has been.</i>

366
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:12,511
<i>But they were playing.</i>

367
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:17,987
<i>May be this people only pretended
to play? And in reality it was a record.</i>

368
00:58:18,832 --> 00:58:19,921
<i>But why?</i>

369
00:58:20,493 --> 00:58:27,357
<i>To prevent you from hearing the shot which
was fired at that moment at the kitchen.</i>

370
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:30,516
<i>The first shot in this story.</i>

371
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:20,225
I don't get it!

372
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:26,571
Even if Nikolaev was killed,
why this show was needed?

373
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:31,310
First of all, I am not saying that
he was killed. It's just a version.

374
00:59:32,645 --> 00:59:41,633
It's true, this story looks quit
strange... to find a planned murder in it.

375
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:45,637
But may be the plotters were hoping for it?

376
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:56,124
They needed to convince you, the stranger,
that you were witnessing a suicide.

377
00:59:57,486 --> 01:00:00,972
And they have succeeded in this.

378
01:00:11,322 --> 01:00:13,611
Nikolay Ivanovich... I
need to go to Moscow.

379
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:24,206
I see, you don't understand
how serious Nikolaev's case is.

380
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:31,234
It concerns the state's interests.

381
01:00:55,231 --> 01:01:01,195
From the times of Tartar invasion
the main idea which unites us all,

382
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:08,005
the idea which so many generations of our
ancestors have served is the idea of the statehood.

383
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:15,358
Powerful, great state is the ideal for
witch Russian is ready to suffer for,

384
01:01:16,012 --> 01:01:21,514
ready to take any hardship,
to give his own life for.

385
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:33,226
This is irrational idea. This is not that pragmatic
European desire to get the largest benefit for yourself.

386
01:01:33,471 --> 01:01:43,249
This is the idea of the Russian spirit, which
dominates and dissolves your and mine personality.

387
01:01:43,576 --> 01:01:46,626
but it gives back a hundred times more.

388
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:59,591
This feeling of connection to a great organism
gives the feeling of spirit, power and immortality.

389
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:07,243
'West' always wanted to
compromise the idea of our statehood.

390
01:02:07,571 --> 01:02:12,991
But the biggest danger for our idea
is not in the West - it is in ourselves.

391
01:02:13,427 --> 01:02:22,361
We ourselves grab these endless, fashionable little ideas from the
West, being captivated by their clear practicality and rationality.

392
01:02:23,695 --> 01:02:30,205
Not even thinking that exactly in
them is hidden the destructive force.

393
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:41,186
It's all right. Our own idea
in the end will be at the top.

394
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:51,290
Look for yourself - all of our revolutions in the end led
not to the destruction but to the strengthening of the state.

395
01:02:52,379 --> 01:02:54,422
And it will be always this way.

396
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:07,660
Not many people realize that this is one of
the most critical moments of our history...

397
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:23,812
and cook Nikolaev's case, very simple at
first glance, has incredibly deep meaning.

398
01:03:24,738 --> 01:03:31,438
So... Aleksey Mikhailovich,
you can't leave the town.

399
01:03:40,671 --> 01:03:43,477
What do I have to do?

400
01:03:44,212 --> 01:03:46,256
Nothing.

401
01:03:48,598 --> 01:03:56,770
Just one thing... if somebody asks,
don't deny that you are cook's son.

402
01:03:57,369 --> 01:03:59,711
Makhmood.

403
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,112
<i>Varakin?</i>

404
01:04:34,903 --> 01:04:36,864
<i>Would you like to have some fun?</i>

405
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:38,743
What?

406
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:44,817
<i>My girlfriend and I are dieing of boredom,
and I thought may be you want to have fun.</i>

407
01:04:46,369 --> 01:04:47,458
Who are you?

408
01:04:47,867 --> 01:04:51,871
<i>we could make dumplings
and you get the wine.</i>

409
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,731
Listen, stop acting like a hooligan!

410
01:04:56,229 --> 01:04:57,836
<i>As you wish.</i>

411
01:05:08,896 --> 01:05:10,201
Who?

412
01:05:26,763 --> 01:05:29,132
I am here on business.

413
01:05:29,949 --> 01:05:33,191
Vasiliy Nokolaevich Chugunov,
the writer, wants to see you.

414
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:35,697
Why?

415
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:40,354
This is very important for you. I
have a car, we can go right now.

416
01:05:43,132 --> 01:05:44,876
I won't go.

417
01:05:45,421 --> 01:05:51,385
I beg you. It is your father
Nikolaev we are talking about.

418
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,176
Aleksey Mikhailovich?

419
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:23,477
Yes.

420
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:29,532
I am glad to meet you. I am Chugunov.

421
01:06:33,344 --> 01:06:35,060
Please.

422
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:08,480
I know that you were the
witness of cook Nikolaev's suicide.

423
01:07:12,948 --> 01:07:18,586
The thing is that Nikolaev was the first
person to dance rock-n-roll in our town.

424
01:07:20,193 --> 01:07:24,169
It happened in the Palace of Culture.

425
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:30,161
On May 18th 1957.

426
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:35,609
Watch...

427
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:46,477
It was usual evening
for the young people...

428
01:07:46,968 --> 01:07:52,251
Well, you know... they gather
together, dance, have fun.

429
01:07:53,504 --> 01:07:56,963
Even now It's unclear
how Nikolaev got there.

430
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:05,462
He was 27 already, he was a lieutenant...
One way or another he was there.

431
01:08:05,707 --> 01:08:09,166
Now look - Nikolaev is
walking across the room.

432
01:08:10,556 --> 01:08:13,333
Watch, watch. It will start now.

433
01:08:24,637 --> 01:08:32,918
Here... Do you see, waltz suddenly stops, rock-n-roll
is playing. You see, everybody is confused.

434
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:37,820
Until now nobody knows who switched
the records. Now look what Nikolaev does...

435
01:09:23,444 --> 01:09:29,900
That was a true scandal. Our town hasn't seen anything
like this since the strike of Left Social Revolutionaries.

436
01:09:31,179 --> 01:09:39,404
And now take a look at this young man - Nikolay
Smorodinov, the head of our town Komsomol Committee.

437
01:09:40,331 --> 01:09:44,525
On the following day he expelled
Nikolaev and his partner from Komsomol.

438
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:50,218
Nikolaev was fired from Police force and Lida
Shulakova was expelled from the Medical Academy.

439
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:58,634
She tried to commit suicide - she drank vinegar. She was
saved but her throat was burnt and she can't speak since then.

440
01:10:21,324 --> 01:10:25,083
Nikolaev found work in the
mess hall, then in the restaurant,

441
01:10:25,573 --> 01:10:27,942
was quiet...

442
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:36,060
But I knew one day he will
do something... and I was right.

443
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:43,005
To make such show out of your own death! He
was the only person, capable for such thing.

444
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:51,231
Do you know that the public
prosecutor thinks that he was killed?

445
01:10:51,585 --> 01:11:01,827
And do you know that our prosecutor is that Smorodinov,
who expelled Shulakova and Nikolaev from Komsomol?

446
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:14,275
All this is very interesting, but... I
don't understand why I am involved in this?

447
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:24,407
The thing is that today in our town the
club, named after Nikolaev, will be opened.

448
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:30,372
And I would like you to be at it's opening.

449
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:33,804
Me?

450
01:11:35,465 --> 01:11:37,017
But why me?

451
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,352
But you are Nikolaev's son.

452
01:12:03,138 --> 01:12:07,252
So, should we go to the
stage? It is time to start.

453
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:13,216
Hello, Ivan Filipovich.
Thank you for coming.

454
01:12:39,173 --> 01:12:41,788
Hello, Nikolay Ivanovich.

455
01:12:47,209 --> 01:12:49,061
Are you going to perform?

456
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:58,105
What should I do, Nikolay Ivanovich? It is stupid!
What can I say about the man I didn't know?

457
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:05,377
Say a couple of words... What do they say in such
cases? ...that he was a good man and so forth.

458
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:09,217
But I have to speak of
him like of my own father!

459
01:13:12,023 --> 01:13:16,843
<i>Aleksey Mikhailovich. Aleksey
Mikhailovich, we are waiting for you!</i>

460
01:13:41,766 --> 01:13:48,140
Friends! The rock-n-roll club
is opening today in our town!

461
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:55,275
This is another big victory of Democracy!

462
01:13:57,754 --> 01:14:03,092
After the epochs of Satanism,
voluntarism, subjectivism, depression

463
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:08,430
we have carried through a passionate
desire to dance what we want!

464
01:14:12,544 --> 01:14:19,244
Friends... the first person in our town
to dance rock-n-roll was cook Nikolaev.

465
01:14:22,949 --> 01:14:29,023
It is always difficult for the first man. But
there is a second man after the first one.

466
01:14:29,376 --> 01:14:35,941
and this is a great logic of the history's
progress, which is impossible to stop!

467
01:14:40,763 --> 01:14:48,606
Let me introduce to
you cook Nikolaev's son.

468
01:15:06,311 --> 01:15:11,785
Comrades, I have to tell you honestly that
I haven't known well this wonderful man.

469
01:15:13,311 --> 01:15:19,575
It happened so, we rarely saw
each other... just one single time.

470
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:29,980
He was a very good man, good cook also. I
ate his solyanka and steak. Not bad at all.

471
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,839
Do you dance rock-n-roll?

472
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:38,232
What should I say? I danced
before, while studying in Academy.

473
01:15:38,858 --> 01:15:40,139
Dance!

474
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,099
Really, dance!

475
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,477
Rock, rock, rock!

476
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:05,278
Everybody is dancing!

477
01:17:52,325 --> 01:17:54,231
Silence please.

478
01:18:00,904 --> 01:18:08,640
Never! He could never shoot himself!

479
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:12,671
He had no guts!

480
01:18:14,905 --> 01:18:19,590
Now watch... the way
it's supposed to be done.

481
01:20:18,757 --> 01:20:20,772
Hello. We need Varakin.

482
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:22,589
It's me.

483
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:25,266
May we come in?

484
01:20:25,784 --> 01:20:27,282
Please.

485
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:44,442
Sit down.

486
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:06,097
My name is Lidia Shulakova...

487
01:21:07,214 --> 01:21:09,474
and this is my son. She means me.

488
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:14,513
So what do you need?

489
01:21:15,411 --> 01:21:26,798
I am Lidia Shulakova, a person
who danced rock-n-roll with Nikolaev.

490
01:21:30,175 --> 01:21:37,611
For that I was expelled
from the Medical Academy,

491
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:43,304
I have drunken vinegar and lost my voice.

492
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:50,331
Oh, I remember. Chugunov told me about you.

493
01:21:55,615 --> 01:22:00,845
I have some Nikolaev's belongings...

494
01:22:02,153 --> 01:22:05,802
they are very dear for me.

495
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:10,705
But I want to give them to you.

496
01:22:38,216 --> 01:22:39,441
Thank you.

497
01:22:40,504 --> 01:22:46,523
You know... if this things are so important to
you, may be you should keep them to yourself?

498
01:22:56,165 --> 01:22:59,625
Thank you for you being like him.

499
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,680
You have preserved our ideals.

500
01:23:22,151 --> 01:23:25,773
I want to dance with you.

501
01:24:02,736 --> 01:24:04,071
Good evening.

502
01:24:04,397 --> 01:24:05,650
Hello.

503
01:24:08,183 --> 01:24:10,852
Here is Varakin Aleksey Mikhailovich.

504
01:24:11,043 --> 01:24:13,740
I am glad to meet you. I
am Ivanov Stepan Filipovich.

505
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:15,402
The head of our city hall.

506
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,768
This is Lidia Shulakova. Yes, that one.

507
01:24:22,075 --> 01:24:23,628
Glad, glad.

508
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:34,986
I wanted to meet you for a long
time. Thank you for coming, for helping.

509
01:24:36,456 --> 01:24:38,880
The case isn't over yet, Stepan Filipovich.

510
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:42,367
Yes, that's true. There is
a lot of work yet to be done.

511
01:24:42,667 --> 01:24:46,317
But there are changes
this is the main thing.

512
01:24:46,698 --> 01:24:51,874
The fact that rock-n-roll is being
rehabilitated has a big, political meaning.

513
01:24:52,582 --> 01:24:54,706
We can't calm down now, Stepan Filipovich.

514
01:24:54,897 --> 01:24:57,920
But we aren't calming down, Vasiliy...

515
01:25:02,006 --> 01:25:03,006
Please.

516
01:25:03,177 --> 01:25:04,177
Thank you.

517
01:25:16,932 --> 01:25:21,399
O! The hero of the day!
Why did you come here?

518
01:25:24,749 --> 01:25:26,602
I came to Aleksey Mikhailovich on business.

519
01:25:27,364 --> 01:25:29,679
If on business, come on in then.

520
01:25:38,396 --> 01:25:40,493
How could you disgrace
yourself so badly, Nikolay?

521
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:44,416
Mit', turn up the volume.

522
01:25:47,303 --> 01:25:48,856
You'll ruin Russia!

523
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:51,116
It's you, who ruins it!

524
01:25:51,361 --> 01:25:54,385
Enough, enough...

525
01:25:55,665 --> 01:25:58,105
How long are you planning to
stay here, Aleksey Mikhailovich?

526
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:04,463
Yes... You know, I, actually, need to be
in Moscow. Could you help me to leave?

527
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:06,669
You can't leave now.

528
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:15,712
Listen, Stepan Filipovich, I would like to
talk to you in private. This is very important.

529
01:26:16,475 --> 01:26:18,599
Please, I am at your service.

530
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,985
Could we speak right now?

531
01:26:23,938 --> 01:26:25,463
I am ready.

532
01:26:25,735 --> 01:26:29,359
Than may be we should
step into the corridor?

533
01:26:42,052 --> 01:26:43,168
Hello.

534
01:26:43,495 --> 01:26:45,838
O! Hi, Pavel.

535
01:26:50,087 --> 01:26:58,203
Aleksey Mikhailovich, I was walking along the corridor and
noticed the girls guarding your door. I have invited them.

536
01:27:01,744 --> 01:27:05,667
Thank you. Hello...

537
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:19,014
We phoned you. Remember?
We made dumplings and got beer.

538
01:27:19,422 --> 01:27:20,921
Dumplings - it is great.

539
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,208
How could you disgrace yourself, Nikolay?

540
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:25,305
Leave me alone.

541
01:27:31,271 --> 01:27:34,403
Well, let's drink beer.

542
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:36,773
Let me.

543
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:53,524
To progress!

544
01:27:53,796 --> 01:27:54,796
I won't drink.

545
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:56,050
Why?

546
01:27:56,139 --> 01:27:57,637
I won't drink to this.

547
01:27:57,638 --> 01:27:58,890
Let him go to hell.

548
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,595
You don't want to drink to
progress?! Drink to your mother then.

549
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:04,855
I'll drink to my mother.

550
01:28:05,401 --> 01:28:08,478
What should we do with the
dumplings? We don't have any plates.

551
01:28:09,214 --> 01:28:12,917
Here is the spoon. Take it
and eat right from the pot.

552
01:28:26,019 --> 01:28:33,155
Aleksey Mikhailovich, we came to you on business. Tamara
wants to exchange her room to the room in Tbilisi.

553
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:36,043
Would you help?

554
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:40,047
No... It would work only via the
triple-exchange. Nobody will exchange straight.

555
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:46,557
We won't let Tamara go to Tbilisi.
We need such gorgeous girls ourselves!

556
01:28:48,518 --> 01:28:51,378
But seriously... I see you are a deputy.

557
01:28:52,522 --> 01:28:57,671
I am not a deputy now,
but simply a man in love.

558
01:28:58,514 --> 01:28:59,958
Oh, he is in love right a way.

559
01:29:00,394 --> 01:29:04,969
By the way, Stepan Filipovich, since we are
talking business... We don't have a chief engineer.

560
01:29:09,247 --> 01:29:11,698
We also wanted to sing for you.

561
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:17,473
Let me sing.

562
01:29:17,662 --> 01:29:18,662
Don't stand out.

563
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:21,776
No, he is pretty good singer.

564
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:42,205
'Sokolov's choir at Yar... was famous once.
Sokolov's guitar is singing in my ears still.

565
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:50,076
Money, money money is everywhere.
Money is everywhere, gentlemen.

566
01:29:50,321 --> 01:29:57,239
Life is bad without the
money, completely worthless.'

567
01:29:58,138 --> 01:30:01,216
Hello. May we join you?

568
01:30:02,142 --> 01:30:03,151
And who are you?

569
01:30:03,341 --> 01:30:08,026
We live in the neighboring room. We
are the shipping clerks from KievOblRem.

570
01:30:09,497 --> 01:30:12,929
We have heard your singing
and decided to take a look.

571
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:14,291
Good for you.

572
01:30:14,482 --> 01:30:18,185
We have beer. And where are you from?

573
01:30:18,349 --> 01:30:24,641
We are local. I am the head of City Hall, this is our
public prosecutor, this is the director of the factory

574
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:29,599
and this is Chugunov - the head
of the local... what's it's name?

575
01:30:30,498 --> 01:30:31,532
writers'...

576
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:34,174
Yes, the writer's organization.

577
01:30:35,210 --> 01:30:36,572
So everybody is local.

578
01:30:37,389 --> 01:30:38,669
But Varakin isn't ours.

579
01:30:38,887 --> 01:30:43,762
Oh, yes... Varakin Aleksey
Mikhailovich is cook Nikolaev's son.

580
01:30:47,576 --> 01:30:48,576
Very pleasant company.

581
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,875
I don't get it, are you going to listen or
not? We are singing and you are chatting here!

582
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:56,483
You are singing nonsense.

583
01:30:57,708 --> 01:30:58,708
Sing yourself then.

584
01:30:59,097 --> 01:31:04,191
Stop Nikolay. You
here... Go ahead and sing.

585
01:31:04,409 --> 01:31:06,779
Why should we sing?
You don't listen any way?

586
01:31:08,985 --> 01:31:11,518
Which song do you want to
hear, Aleksey Mikhailovich?

587
01:31:15,168 --> 01:31:17,102
Me?

588
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:39,764
'Night is bright, the moon is silently shining above
the river. And the blue wave is glittering with silver.

589
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:57,251
The dark forest is there, in silence of emerald-colored
branches. The nightingale doesn't sing his clear songs.

590
01:31:58,204 --> 01:32:12,967
The blue flowers are blooming under the
Moon, they wake up the dreams in my heart.

591
01:32:13,921 --> 01:32:28,439
In this moonlit night my dear friend, tender
friend, you are loved as before. Remember me.'

592
01:32:50,501 --> 01:32:53,171
Let's go to the oak tree.

593
01:32:54,806 --> 01:33:02,785
Aleksey Mokhailovich, we have an oak tree
here... Dmitriy Donskoy himself sat under it.

594
01:33:06,409 --> 01:33:08,969
Right, let's go.

595
01:34:49,205 --> 01:34:53,209
This oak tree is 1200 years old.

596
01:34:53,591 --> 01:35:02,470
Before Christian times this tree was considered to be sacred.
A man who broke a brunch off it would become a tribe leader.

597
01:35:04,676 --> 01:35:09,579
But to keep his power, a
man had to guard the tree.

598
01:35:10,124 --> 01:35:20,557
Of cause, one day somebody would kill him, brake
off the branch and would become a new tribe leader.

599
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:30,198
In more civilized era this tradition lost it's meaning,
but Dmitriy Donskoy and later Ivan the Terrible,

600
01:35:30,459 --> 01:35:37,117
who used to come here, were braking
off the branches from our oak tree.

601
01:35:38,098 --> 01:35:41,067
The tree was taken under the
protection of the state after 1917.

602
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:43,246
May I take a branch as a memento?

603
01:35:44,090 --> 01:35:45,534
No, it's not aloud.

604
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:50,218
Just the smallest one...

605
01:35:50,246 --> 01:35:51,717
Let her brake it off.

606
01:35:53,841 --> 01:35:57,028
Well, since the City Hall is allowing...

607
01:36:03,837 --> 01:36:05,254
It has rotted completely.

608
01:36:05,499 --> 01:36:06,888
It had to be watered.

609
01:36:07,897 --> 01:36:11,220
Well, since it's broken everybody may take.

610
01:36:25,056 --> 01:36:26,056
This is a good one...

611
01:36:27,153 --> 01:36:29,360
May I take one for my brother?

612
01:36:32,438 --> 01:36:34,127
Run.

613
01:36:35,325 --> 01:36:36,388
What?

614
01:36:38,321 --> 01:36:40,691
Run, I am telling you.

615
01:36:41,699 --> 01:36:42,870
Where?
